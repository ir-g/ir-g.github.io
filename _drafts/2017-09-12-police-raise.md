title: "The Police raise isn’t what it might seem"
---

The UK government today announced that they are intending to scrap the cap on pay for Police and Prison officers, with pay to go up to about 2%. The issue with this is that this isn’t actually a raise.

Instead half of the raise is a “contribution” which means that it is not necessarily going to be persisted across future years. This makes this raise more akin to a bonus, because it is merely a one-off action. Furthermore this will not be consolidated, making next years pay rise based on last years wage +1%, as opposed to what everyone actually got paid.

And while the government tries to manipulate the forces of compound interest, many Police and Crime Commissioners in England(including the West Midlands PCC) fear that this will force them to lay off staff due to no matching increase in the force budgets.
