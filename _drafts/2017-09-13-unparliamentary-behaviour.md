title: Unparliamentary behaviour

The government, apparently minded to pretend it has the vast majority of voters or constituencies, has made inroads into giving itself more power with less accountability.

It appears to be on its way to both having both control of public bill committees and “Henry VIII powers” - being able to legislate without meaningful parliamentary process. Between them, it puts good governance and fair democracy in a bad place.
