title: Comprehensively Incompetent
---

We’ve had a day in which the Prime Minister has managed to seem more and more removed from any sense of control of her government. Two secretary of states are being criticised for offences that would normally result in the sack, and look unfathomably safe.

Boris Johnson managed to make another mess-up, after having continually struggled to toe the government line on Brexit, managed to make a mess-up of trying to deal with the fallout from a cock-up in which he indicated that the British-Iranian Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe was training journalists in Iran, claims that Zaghari-Ratcliffe had denied when first put by Iran as part of their accusations of propaganda efforts. Boris has refused to apologise or accept that he had made a mistake, instead offering supposed clarification and contacting his Iranian opposite number. But this seems too late, as the remarks soon lead to Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s own sentence now potentially being doubled from five to ten years. Johnson gained assurances from Tehran that this move is irrelevant of his comments, but the Iranian Judiciary website specifically cited Johnson’s comment as the basis for this potential extension, in what puts the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in what should be an untenable position.

Priti Patel, Sec. of State for Dept. for International Development managed to also put the FCO in a sticky position, in a rather astonishing turn of events. It appears that she was on a ‘family holiday’ in Israel that was equipped with a rather [jam-packed itinerary](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/statement-from-international-development-secretary-priti-patel), with a rather more professional nature to it, not least the apparent highlight - a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, which apparently entailed discussions of potentially UK Aid going to fund Israeli Military humanitarian efforts in an area of the region not recognised formally by the UK. All of which only came to the PM’s attention when listening to the BBC apparently.

*In normal times this wouldn’t have happened, whatever normal times are.*
