*This is an old article I wrote as a what and where for SSH, as an explainer for people new to the command line.*

## SSH?

 SSH is a remote command-line system, enabling the carrying-out of commands, and use of command-line applications(Like [nano]), remotely. SSH is an incredibly popular and flexible system of controlling servers, accessing intranets, and transferring files.

## How Powerful?

Well, SSH can do everything a normal command-line can do, should you set it up as so, to run just like a standard terminal.

## The what and why...

### Using what?

Any computer device with an SSH application, and sufficient networking capabilities. Some Smartphones can SSH, and most major Computer operating systems have SSH applications built-in. There are also many downloadable SSH applications, too.

E.G. In terminal(Ubuntu and most other OS's), you can type in:

```bash
ssh [user]@[host]
 ```

(Replacing [user] with your SSH username, and [host] with your SSH host IP.)

### Why?

SSH is a quick and easy way to virtualise code, handle files remotely, and  is quite good for accessibility standards, as well.
