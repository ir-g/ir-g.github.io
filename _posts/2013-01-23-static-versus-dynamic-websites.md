Static websites, websites where no server-side scripts run, have had a rise in popularity, after years of being abandoned for the more popular way of putting a CMS(Content Management System) on a server, like Drupal, WordPress, or Joomla. Here are some of the Pros and Cons of Each.

##Dynamic Websites

_Sites based off a CMS, like WordPress._

###Pros

- Can be edited easily, with forms to fill in.
- Can be re-themed in a moment.
- Can have self-hosted comments.
- Can have self-hosted user management.

###Cons

- Can be slow.
- Uses up more processing power.
- Can be easily hacked.
- Have editing limitations (You are stuck with a web-based editor, as a rule of thumb, including CMS pre-formatting).

##Static Websites

_Sites with non-dynamic content, may have content generated with static site generators, like Jekyll._

###Pros

- Speedy
- Looks professional
- Very good for developing everything
- Increases likelihood of lots of users(Less wait, more content absorption.)
- Can edit on the move (Dropbox, etc...)

###Cons

- Reliance on separate host for comments.
- No member system.

##Overall...

Static is faster, but for very large sites, a dynamic site can help for reasons involving many authors and very large databases.
