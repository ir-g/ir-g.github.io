The Guardian has recently made an interactive feature article, concerning the state of working pay and conditions in Bangladesh, alongside the UK shops' own inaction in retail. The article was [here](http://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2014/apr/bangladesh-shirt-on-your-back), using a responsive website made  up of a combination of video and text, sights and sounds, to create a truly interesting and immersive experience.

The site suprised me, as the use of multimedia, and interactivity didn't seem to be "in your face", so to speak; the site enhanced the viewing experience, as opposed to obscuring it, a difficult balancing act when approaching such a task. The site was clear, informative, and quite remarkable.
