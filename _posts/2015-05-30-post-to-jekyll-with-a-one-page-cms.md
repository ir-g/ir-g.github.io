[jekyll-post-via-web](https://github.com/vrypan/jekyll-post-via-web) is a project which provides a one-page CMS system which can be added to Jekyll-based blogs. This works through using the GitHub API to create new posts, when the writer fills in a simple form.

There is a bookmarklet available, which also speeds up the process of sharing links with people, as well. I have added this system to my own site, where it works very well. This project is a very simple but awesome way to share content.
