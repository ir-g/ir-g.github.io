It was privatised many years back, and since, the pricing of tickets has since risen unfairly, with for-profit companies charging obscene amounts of money for sub-standard services. This needs to stop.</p><p name="c457" id="c457" class="graf--p graf-after--p">Putting safety before shareholders, makes sense, benefits rail users, and can help fund rail projects, many of which have been suspended by the current government(<a href="http://gu.com/p/4a5f4/sbl" data-href="http://gu.com/p/4a5f4/sbl" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow">http://gu.com/p/4a5f4/sbl</a>). This means of operation, where the state, or a state-owned company runs the railways, is not only a proven means of operation, but is the only way of rectifying the brutally opportunistic fares system, and lack of progress on mass electrification.</p><p name="9522" id="9522" class="graf--p graf-after--p graf--last"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">If you agree with this, and believe in the UK regaining a nationalised rail service, sign the petition, here: </em><a href="http://j.mp/nationalised-rail-petition" data-href="http://j.mp/nationalised-rail-petition" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow">http://j.mp/nationalised-rail-petition</a></p></div></div>
