title: Protecting National Rail
description: Remember Railtrack?
---



The Conservative Government is at it again - It just can't stop itself from trying to sell off state-operated companies, all reasoned as part of the (twice-delayed) "long-term economic plan".

This time the policy geniuses at Number 10 have decided upon something that had been privatised previously - National Rail - known during its privatised years as Railtrack, which was put into administration due to its simultaneous disregard for safety(notably a primary cause of the [hatfield crash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatfield_rail_crash)), and for its financial instability.

This privatisation of National Rail would not help shareholders, who severely lost out previously, it would not help the railways in growth or maintenance, as they would have primary responsibility to look after dividends for shareholders over repairing rails.

To help keep the rails safe for years to come, consider signing [this petition](), or contact the Shaw Report consultation, before 24 December 2015 at 23:45, via [this tool](http://weownit.org.uk/act-now/dont-let-grinches-privatise-network-rail), or at [gov.uk](https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/shaw-report-scoping-study).
