People love to think to use apps over websites - they tend to be more minimal, and the native appearance of an application tends to look far better than an unstyled web page. Not to mention the numerous accessibility benefits found for screen readers.

The typical issue with developing applications, is that the User Interface has to be re-designed with each OS update, and tons of effort has to go into developing and maintaining native application code.

I created a project that provides at least the basis for a Node server providing the interface for a Visual Basic client application.
