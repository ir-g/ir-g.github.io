I have written about the Labour Leadership contest, and the nomination process in the new liberal publication Evolving Tide.

On nomination
So, the court has just decided on the case Foster -v- McNicol and Corbyn that Jeremy Corbyn will not be required to go through the nomination process in the Labour Leadership challenge. This, if polls are to believed is, erm, unfortunate for Labour.

Corbyn doesn’t poll awfully well with the general public.

On this basis, you might think that Labour might want some people familiar with the general public, people who have Labour’s electoral success as their number one priority. Crucially, some of these people should probably have first shout as to whether somebody should land on a ballot paper.
And there is a process for that — nomination by PLP/EPLP members. And if the present[incumbent] leader was subject to the same process, then it would allow for a leader who has lost the support of their elected colleagues to be challenged and actually have to seek support of their elected colleagues, rather than merely depending on the membership — which can include of people who don’t necessarily have the Labour party’s best interests at heart particularly with regard to electability.
The electability of Labour party is deeply dependent on being able to remove leaders who are deemed unpopular — and it is as important that we can discuss the rules sensibly, as it is that we can ensure the right outcome.
I think it would no doubt be interesting if the story behind the “incumbent exception” was told. It appears that the rule was brought in by Ed Miliband, whether it was because of his own fears that someone would attempt to remove him, or for another reason entirely — I think perhaps it is time to hear why it was brought it.
