title: Theresa May could reform yet
---

When Theresa May entered office, she gave a speech talking about the extent of inequality that government presided over, and indicated strong desires to reform many issues that were often disregarded by politicians, particularly those of the Conservative party. In demonstrating her willingness to consider Miliband-esque interventionist approaches, some thought that she might be able to unite the country by tackling ignored issues, and producing sensible initiatives.

Alas, this seems to have all fallen down somewhat…

The opportunity to see energy prices, executive pay and other issues dealt with would have been relatively uncontroversial among much of her own party, and could have commanded cross-party support in many cases.

But now that she has even reneged on making private schools work with nearby schools to raise their standards to preserve their charitable status, despite the support for it being almost universal, it doesn’t seem likely that the May is willing to pursue radical legislation, even when it could help her ailing government’s image.

The opportunity to seek cross-party support for issues would allow Labour’s increased numbers and the Conservatives social liberals to make solid inroads into resolving perceived issues within “the system” at large. Shareholder pay package votes becoming binding, proper energy price regulation and efforts to resolve the concerns around both business rates harming small business and local government not receive funding that matches demand, are just some ways we could see the government put effort into talking with parliamentarians of all stripes to make a sluggish, Brexit-dominated parliament into a productive, impactful one.
