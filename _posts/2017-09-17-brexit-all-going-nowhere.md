title: "Brexit: All going nowhere?"

All-encompassing Brexit has messed with the end of this week. Here’s some of what happened.

Despite recent outbursts, Boris [claims he backs May on Brexit](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-41289080), while claiming that £350m/wk for the NHS could yet happen, after the agreements with Brussels are settled. SkyNews’ Faisal Islam sees an [apparent agreement with EU Chief Negotiator Michel Barnier](https://twitter.com/faisalislam/status/908965684515934208) among the 4000 word PR puff piece. Both [the Beeb](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-41289080) and Sky note the £350m figure is wrong. Sky carried this on their News at 10:

![Gross payment: £326m, After rebate: £251m, Actual contribution: £165m](/images/2017-09-17-brexit-all-going-nowhere.png)

This does see mild relief, without complete certainty, that Boris isn’t trying to do a full leadership attempt just yet, but you can never be sure it seems. Tory MSP(and Tory group leader) [Ruth Davidson’s words on twitter](https://twitter.com/RuthDavidsonMSP/status/908804118629711878) gave a subtle hint:

> On the day of a terror attack where Britons were maimed, just hours after the threat level is raised, our only thoughts should be on service

Labour MP Alison McGovern [makes some excellent points on customs issues](https://twitter.com/Alison_McGovern/status/908674922565767168) with the HMRC not being able to handle any “no deal” scenario. Gov & IT issues taken to the next level with both the current system not working sufficiently and the new system not able to a handle significant increase in customs to the degree that would happen with EU exit. 

*Whether or not people believe brexit is right, the government continues to be set on being defiant in its cluelessness.*
