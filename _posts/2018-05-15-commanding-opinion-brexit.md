In terms of Brexit, so much is happening, but so little is moving. There is presently no hint when the EU withdrawal bill will be returned to the commons, after the House Of Lords [voted for a number of amendments opposed by government](https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/government-suffers-12th-brexit-bill-defeat-as-lords-back-removal-of-exit-day_uk_5af1c8cae4b0ab5c3d6a7e95) which will have to be voted on in the Commons. They proposed the following:

* The current fixed exit date should be removed from the bill.
* The Lords be granted the power to refer statutory instruments back to the Commons.
  * *Hence making implemented EU law harder for the government to modify*
* UK participation of the EEA(European Economic Area) continuing.
  * *Hence continuing single market access*
* Allowing the UK to participate in EU agencies
  * *Likely to affect matters like membership of Euratom*

At the same time, the cabinet is trying to decide on the Customs Options of either Maximum Facilitation or Customs Partnership options. The former uses mystical, undefined technology, while the latter entails some form of arrangement UK would collect tariffs on behalf of the EU, both carry the hope of allowing free movement of goods between the UK and the EU. In reality, both had been initially rejected by the EU, but the Customs Partnership seems to be gaining the chance of acceptance as the [Irish PM Leo Varadkar said it was](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/may/09/jeremy-corbyn-both-of-mays-customs-union-plans-are-implausible) "[a] welcome suggestion". This does offer the chance that the borders at the Eurotunnel and the NI/ROI border could seemingly operate without infrastructure, which is something that could allow the UK to operate its own trade deals.
