The government managed to demonstrate twice today that independent commissioners and their reports are sometimes either fearing or receiving government rejection or intervention.

Firstly, the [Dame Hackitt review was revealed](https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/dame-judith-hackitt-not-expert-on-grenfell-report_uk_5afd7d8be4b0779345d68b4f) as [ridiculously timid](https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/hackitt-review_uk_5afd46cde4b0a59b4e00c9ac), which the government had seemed fine with until the report was released to media ridicule - due to the lack of endorsement of a ban of combustible cladding and no examination of the circumstances of the Grenfell fire that had triggered the enquiry. This led to the government all of a sudden decide to announce that it would consult on a ban of combustible cladding, making the entire review look like a time-wasting farce, as opposed to a matter of serious meaning. As a side note, the other big concern in this government department is another huge issue - the need for four million more homes. James Brokenshire's return to the front-bench looks like quite the baptism of fire. 

Secondly, the Independent Anti-Slavery commissioner [announced his resignation](http://web.archive.org/web/20180517210210/http://www.antislaverycommissioner.co.uk/news-insights/ending-my-tenure-as-independent-anti-slavery-commissioner/), and he on the same day gave an [exit interview](http://web.archive.org/web/20180517210325/http://news.trust.org/item/20180517132631-x0qfw/) in which he expressed frustration with government intervention in his role. This now begs the question: What did they intervene on? He refused to elaborate in the interview, but hopefully a parliamentary committee will pick this up(perhaps the home affairs select committee?), because this matter cannot be left ignored.

Whether the government will hit a hat-trick this week remains to be seen, but even when this government seemingly does nothing, they still seem to screw up everything.
