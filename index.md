Hi! I'm <span class="non-mobile-hide mobile-display-inline">Isaac Reid-Guest, </span>a developer and designer based in Birmingham, United Kingdom.

I <a href="http://twitter.com/{{site.twitter_username}}">tweet</a>, <a href="/blog/">blog</a> and <a href="http://github.com/isaacrg">code</a>.

I have made a number of software projects, mostly on <a href="https://github.com/isaacrg?tab=repositories">Github</a>. If you have a project you're interested in showing me, just <a href="/contact">Contact Me</a>.

I also have some interest in UK and International politics, and the wider affect it can and does have.

I occasionally use [Tumblr](http://ir-g.tumblr.com), including [Brevium](http://brevium-uk.tumblr.com/), a publication summing up the news.

If you want to say thanks, why not [pay me here](https://paypal.me/irg)? Any gift appreciated.
