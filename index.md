Hi! I'm <span class="non-mobile-hide mobile-display-inline">Isaac Reid-Guest, </span>a developer and designer based in the United Kingdom.

I <a href="http://twitter.com/{{site.twitter_username}}">tweet</a>, <a href="/blog/">blog</a> and <a href="/code/">code</a>.

I have made a number of software projects - including websites and desktop and mobile applications, often on <a href="https://github.com/ir-g?tab=repositories">Github</a>.

If you have a project you're interested in me developing, prototyping, testing or just having a look at, just <a href="/contact/">Contact Me</a>.




I currently am a writer and editor for [Evolving Tide](https://medium.com/evolving-tide), I also post the odd thing on my [Tumblr](http://tumblr.ir-g.uk/).

If you want to pay me for a project I have worked on, or so I can make more, you can [pay me via PayPal](https://paypal.me/irg)? Any amount is appreciated.
