Hi! I'm <span class="non-mobile-hide mobile-display-inline">Isaac Reid-Guest, </span>a developer and designer based in Birmingham, United Kingdom.

I <a href="http://twitter.com/{{site.twitter_username}}">tweet</a>, <a href="/blog/">blog</a> and <a href="/code/">code</a>.

I have made a number of software projects - including websites and desktop and mobile applications, often on <a href="https://github.com/isaacrg?tab=repositories">Github</a>.

If you have a project you're interested in me developing, prototyping, testing or just having a look at, just <a href="/contact">Contact Me</a>.

I also have some interest in UK and International politics, and the wider affect it can and does have.

I occasionally use [Tumblr](http://ir-g.tumblr.com), including for writing [Brevium](http://brevium-uk.tumblr.com/), a publication summing up the news.

If you want to pay me for a project I have worked on, or so I can make more, you can <a href="https://flattr.com/submit/auto?fid=vo6rze&url=http%3A%2F%2Fir-g.uk" target="_blank"><img src="//button.flattr.com/flattr-badge-large.png" alt="Flattr this" title="Flattr this" style="height: inherit;" border="0"></a> or [pay me via PayPal](https://paypal.me/irg)? Any amount is appreciated.
