    <title>Tweeting about The Wall is Trump’s happy place – and he’s back there because he’s scared</title>

	Facing the encroaching Mueller investigation and the prospect of dealing with a Democratic House, Trump has retreated to ground on which he feels secure.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-node-image field-type-image field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;noscript class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoints=&quot;300 768 1024&quot; data-adaptive-image-300-img=&quot;&amp;lt;img class=&amp;quot;adaptive-image&amp;quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&amp;quot;300&amp;quot; typeof=&amp;quot;foaf:Image&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2019/01/gettyimages-931532180.jpg?itok=GOgNYCyE&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&quot; data-adaptive-image-768-img=&quot;&amp;lt;img class=&amp;quot;adaptive-image&amp;quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&amp;quot;768&amp;quot; typeof=&amp;quot;foaf:Image&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2019/01/gettyimages-931532180.jpg?itok=GOgNYCyE&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&quot; data-adaptive-image-1024-img=&quot;&amp;lt;img class=&amp;quot;adaptive-image&amp;quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&amp;quot;1024&amp;quot; typeof=&amp;quot;foaf:Image&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2019/01/gettyimages-931532180.jpg?itok=GOgNYCyE&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&quot; data-adaptive-image-max-img=&quot;&amp;lt;img class=&amp;quot;adaptive-image&amp;quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&amp;quot;max&amp;quot; typeof=&amp;quot;foaf:Image&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2019/01/gettyimages-931532180.jpg?itok=GOgNYCyE&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&quot;&gt;&lt;img typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2019/01/gettyimages-931532180.jpg?itok=GOgNYCyE&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;
	Trump spent the holiday break tweeting vigorously about the “Wall”. In fact, since 23 December, he has tweeted about The Wall no fewer than 20 times. “Drones and all of the rest are wonderful and lots of fun, but it is only a good old fashioned Wall that works!” he &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1076844349860823042&quot;&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; on 23 December, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1077052604499353600&quot;&gt;adding&lt;/a&gt; later that afternoon “We need Border Security, and as EVERYONE knows, you can’t have Border Security without a Wall. The Drones &amp;amp; Technology are just bells and whistles. Safety for America!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	His ongoing tirade continued through Christmas Eve, as the “Trump Shutdown” dragged on, leaving government departments unfunded and staff without paychecks over Christmas. “Virtually every Democrat we are dealing with today strongly supported a Border Wall or Fence,” he &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1077210242574942208&quot;&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; (they have not.) “It was only when I made it an important part of my campaign, because people and drugs were pouring into our Country unchecked, that they turned against it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	His position on The Wall has flip-flopped more than a landed salmon. During the campaign, it became his core promise, and central to that promise was the idea that Mexico would pay for it. This idea became one of his most popular call-and-response moments with crowds at rallies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Obviously, however, Mexico has consistently indicated that it would, of course, not be paying to build Trump’s folly. In fact, because much of the border follows either rivers or traverses difficult geography, building a solid wall all across all 1,933 miles of the US-Mexico border would be impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But now he is bending into the kind of rhetorical contortions that would give MC Escher a migraine in order to justify forcing the US taxpayer to pay for his preposterous wall. “The complete Wall will be built with the Shutdown money plus funds already in hand. The reporting has been inaccurate on the point. The problem is, without the Wall, much of the rest of Dollars are wasted!” he &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1077250139503452162&quot;&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; on Christmas Eve, later adding “At some point the Democrats not wanting to make a deal will cost our Country more money than the Border Wall we are all talking about” (it will not).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Trump has flip-flopped on the material of the wall, changing it from his promise of “solid concrete” to a wall made of &lt;a href=&quot;https://edition.cnn.com/2018/12/19/politics/border-wall-mexico-donald-trump/index.html&quot;&gt;metal slats&lt;/a&gt; in order for it to be “see-through”. But his main broken promise is the one that American taxpayers would not have to pay “a cent” for its construction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Of course, that one was a lie too. In fact, just before Christmas, Trump forced the government into shutdown because the Democrats would not offer him money from the federal budget in order to pay for its construction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Most of the time, a government shutdown is a time for the frantic passing-off of blame by both sides. But this was an exception: Trump was more than happy to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/world/north-america/2018/12/trump-has-decided-own-government-shutdown-here-s-why-will-backfire&quot;&gt;take ownership of this shutdown&lt;/a&gt; when challenged by incoming House speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer in an extraordinary and fractious public meeting in December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But Trump continued to thrash about on the subject as the holiday period wore on. “We are already building and renovating many miles of Wall, some complete. Democrats must end Shutdown and finish funding,” he &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1077329121745793025&quot;&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt;, still on Christmas Eve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Public opinion was not bending in his favour. As the backlash against the administration for the horrific deaths of several children in US border patrol custody continued, the president finally addressed it – by attempting to blame the Democrats. “Any deaths of children or others at the Border are strictly the fault of the Democrats and their pathetic immigration policies,” he said on 29 December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When this line of attack failed to gain traction, he tried another new approach. “MEXICO IS PAYING FOR THE WALL through the many billions of dollars a year that the U.S.A. is saving through the new Trade Deal, the USMCA”, he &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1079900120047603713&quot;&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; on New Year’s Eve (it is not).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	He also &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1079906462753869825&quot;&gt;attempted&lt;/a&gt; to give some historical grounding to his ridiculous idea: “Throughout the ages some things NEVER get better and NEVER change. You have Walls and you have Wheels. It was ALWAYS that way and it will ALWAYS be that way! Please explain to the Democrats that there can NEVER be a replacement for a good old fashioned WALL!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Why has the wall become Trump’s holiday obsession? It might be that he is spooked by the Democrats’ taking control of the House of Representatives – the 116th Congress will begin its work on 3 January, and the new Democratic chairs of several House committees will have subpoena power to investigate whatever they want to within the Trump administration. It may be with one eye already on the 2020 presidential election: several strong Democratic candidates are lining up already, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/world/north-america/2018/10/rise-elizabeth-warren-dust-bowl-radical&quot;&gt;Elizabeth Warren&lt;/a&gt;, the popular Massachusetts senator, who officially announced her candidacy on New Year’s Eve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Given both of those pressures, it is unsurprising that Trump, wounded by his dismal midterm election results and scared by the prospect of both the ongoing Mueller investigation and additional summonses by congressional Democrats, is retreating to his happy place – the 2016 campaign – and the sloganeering that served him so well back then.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;Luther&lt;/em&gt; has become burdened by its own success. The BBC’s theatrically gritty portrait of a rain-slicked London and its criminal underworld, always put to rights by down-to-earth man’s man DCI Luther, catapulted the career of Idris Elba and gave a thoroughly deserved boost to Ruth Wilson for her turn as charismatic, unpredictable killer, Alice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It’s nearly a decade since the show started and there have been a number of sidekicks for Luther, all manner of absurd murder plots, and several major character deaths, each less impactful than the last. Perhaps it’s been hard to pin down Elba and Wilson at the same time –&lt;em&gt; Luther&lt;/em&gt; only makes it to air every few years (it’s four since the last season), often doing so without Alice, an enormous part of the show’s dynamism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	What a relief, then, to see her return in the new series – supposedly from the dead. (Alice was ostensibly killed off, but as fans of murder mysteries and &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt; know, if a character dies off screen, they almost certainly didn’t die at all.) Luther’s new DS is played by Wunmi Mosaku, who has racked up a number of British TV roles as a concerned but assertive “supervising” figure in &lt;em&gt;Kiri&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The End of The Fucking World&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Black Mirror&lt;/em&gt;. Here she is given the space to do something different – she seems younger than ever, clever, and both vulnerable and brave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Luther is back to his old ways, gruffly delivering lines such as “Tell the Spice Girls to back off” in his first five minutes on screen. The murders are still outrageous and flamboyant: episode one alone contains a body perforated with nails, a creepy sexual therapist and a take on Agatha Christie’s &lt;em&gt;4.50 From Paddington &lt;/em&gt;using two east London night buses. Who knew our capital city teemed with so many violent sexual deviants wearing clown masks? &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--

	Matthew Engel’s article on the lure of international railway travel stirred in me an old sense of excitement in this form of transport (“Life on the Tracks”, 7 December). In today’s sense-dulling, budget-flight age, it is easy to forget the stimulation and authenticity of long-distance train travel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I would, however, suggest that Mr Engel should rethink his rejection of the Trans-Siberian line. In 1991, I experienced a truly mind-opening experience, travelling from Moscow to Beijing. Irrespective of the fact that these three great countries (including Mongolia) were transitioning from communism to capitalism in very different ways, this journey across so many cultures, landscapes and time zones would be fascinating in any era.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I would happily relive that adventure in what would surely be very different times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I hope, too, they now serve something other than just borscht, before the dining car is changed at the Chinese border.&lt;/p&gt;

	EU myths&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	More Brexit “ignorance is bliss” from Jonathan Notley (Correspondence, 30 November). Where is the bureaucratic control from Brussels – often cited, rarely defined? When were we not able to set our own budget? Brussels tried, sensibly, to apply a limit to budget deficits but it never worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Germany was the first to breach the 3 per cent deficit barrier, in the early 2000s, but nothing could be done. What about our recent huge deficits? Brussels was silent. Take back control – of what? We already control almost everything: budgets, tax rates, welfare spending, work and pensions, education, foreign policy, defence, the NHS, justice, energy, transport, housing, local government…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The EU mainly involves trade and when we lose free access to EU markets the pain will be quickly felt. And as for: agriculture: the CAP has been reformed since the UK joined, and is there really a crying need for cheaper food? (Except among the poor, of course, and there will certainly be more of them.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	I am bemused that some elements of the political left in this country seem to think that the EU is some sort of socialist nirvana, so let me pose this question. What did the EU do to prevent the closure of UK coal mines from 1984-85 and to prevent the privatisation of the railways in 1994?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 style=&quot;line-height: 1.2em;&quot;&gt;
	The Brexit mutiny&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In his interview with Jason Cowley (Encounter, 30 November), Paul Collier brilliantly identifies the heart of the Brexit vote cast by the less educated, 50 per cent- plus. It was a “mutiny”, he says, an act of desperation, with no thought about what the outcome might be; a chance to establish once and for all that social and economic conditions have become beyond intolerable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It was also an act of defiance against the “neglect” and “contemptuous” disregard of the highly educated metropolitan elites, with their overwhelming sense of entitlement to money, wealth and power. To make his point, Collier quotes a &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt; commentator who sees London as “shackled to a corpse”, ie the decaying economic remainsof the UK’s provincial towns and cities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Collier’s solutions are radical: break vested interests, challenge rent-seekers, develop an ethical state, tackle regional inequalities. Can the readers of the &lt;em&gt;NS&lt;/em&gt; have more of this approach to the Brexit fiasco and less on Westminster party politics please?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 style=&quot;line-height: 1.2em;&quot;&gt;
	Federal fractures&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Jeremy Cliffe’s argument (“What Europe can learn from Hamilton”, 7 December) for a greater federal Europe is precisely why it should be avoided. Rather than “healing the fractures”, he downgrades the importance of culture in Europe – with its diversity of language, arts, landscape and myth – and would seek to impose a fiscal and political straitjacket over those elements that many of its citizens hold dear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The euro experiment has clearly failed. Unsurprisingly, Germany is reluctant to bolster those economies unsuited to its strictures. Ignoring the culture and history of member states, in the hope that some sort of homogeneity can be achieved, would, I fear, deliver yet more ammunition to right-wing authoritarian movements, who would exploit this, but whose respect for culture is similarly scant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There is no comparison between the American experience and the vastly longer and deeper cultural patchwork quilt of Europe. No number of foreign summer holidays will change that. Extending the European project from trade and security to a greater political and federal Europe could be seen as an almost Napoleonic error.&lt;/p&gt;

	Age of upheaval&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The dialogue between Rowan Williams and John Gray (“Matters of life and death”, 30 November) excellently supports Jason Cowley’s aspiration for the &lt;em&gt;New Statesman&lt;/em&gt; “to understand… analyse and explain the forces driving this period of extraordinary upheaval” (Editor’s Note, 7 December). However, it and the Christmas special, chock-a-block with interesting pieces, may indicate Jason’s &lt;em&gt;flâneuring&lt;/em&gt; days are behind him. One wonders, though, whether his political scepticism reflects his adult experience: an imbalance of predominantly Conservative-led governments. Nevertheless, impressively, in the Leader (7 December) his scepticism still finds room for the UN rapporteur’s findings on UK poverty, which, “learning from context”, makes an overwhelming case, I hope he agrees, for “what is best in the present context” – a change of government.&lt;/p&gt;

	Idioms idiocy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Can someone among your clever staff or readership please help me with some modern idioms? What is the difference between an “existing” condition and a “pre-existing” condition? Is it not a tautology or a deeply philosophical position to say that if something exists it also exists before it existed? What on earth would Wittgenstein say?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In a similar vein, what on earth is an “existential” threat? Is it some legacy of Jean-Paul Sartre come back to attack us? Or are we just alone in the universe and consequently only a threat to ourselves and from ourselves?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I also note that one can now “pre-order” something. Is that not also an order? Or perhaps an order to raise an order before one can place an order? I’m very confused.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 style=&quot;line-height: 1.2em;&quot;&gt;
	Faith and doubt&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Michael Axworthy is right to identify rebel theologian Pelagius as an important influence on European thought and culture (“The Revenge of Pelagius”, 7 December). Axworthy is also right to recognise that Pelagianism has a downside. The Pelagian outlook, when taken too far, goes well beyond having an optimistic belief in people’s abilities to make the right choices, and risks embracing the belief that people are nothing more than creatures of circumstance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This is where Pelagius’s dispute with Augustine becomes interesting and relevant to many contemporary arguments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One of the more thoughtful writers to identify the importance of these thinkers was Michael Oakeshott. In &lt;em&gt;The Politics of Faith and the Politics of Scepticism &lt;/em&gt;(1953), Oakeshott used Pelagius and Augustine to outline a duality of styles observable in European politics; one, that sought the perfection of “a single, comprehensive condition of human circumstances”; the other, not so much concerned with perfection, instead focusing on the more limited activity of reducing the occasions for conflict between individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Axworthy’s paean to Pelagius ends with a cautious warning from Augustine. Oakeshott would probably agree but would also point to the importance of the ongoing conversation between these two traditions which, to Oakeshott, works best when neither properly prevails nor permanently dominates the other. Liberal humanism has its heroes too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;Benedict Davies&lt;br /&gt;
	Melbourne, Australia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Picking up the &lt;em&gt;NS &lt;/em&gt;only a few hours after midnight mass, I was heartened to read “The Revenge of Pelagius”. Although I rarely go to church these days, the endless repetition of the C of E General Confession often seems at odds with the more positive aspects: the music, the community, and the hope that love can make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In many respects, the clergy of Western churches could “fairly be called Pelagians”, as he says. Self-help, Buddhist thinking and notions of continuous improvement are philosophies the Church would be foolish to ignore. The historic emphasis on unworthiness has been useful to those in power, and the “birth sin” is inherently misogynistic. The doctrine of original sin is a legacy, yet the Church of England’s ninth article of faith still says: “Original Sin standeth not in the following of Adam, (as the Pelagians do vainly talk;) but it is the fault and corruption of the Nature of every man.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Awareness of our own fallibility should be balanced with the notion of original goodness and belief in our own capacity to make a difference. Time for another reformation?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 style=&quot;line-height: 1.2em;&quot;&gt;
	Public practice&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The solution to the problems set out by Dr Phil Walker is to have all GPs employed directly by the NHS – as with nurses, junior doctors and others such as physiotherapists (“The doctor won’t see you now”, 7 December). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It was a gross error at the start of the NHS to allow GPs and consultants to be self-employed and to run, what in effect, are taxpayer-supported private businesses. Seventy years on, this model is no longer fit for purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	They would spend less time on managing, more on seeing patients and part of their contract would be their attachment to a set number of a cross-section of patients. Areas with increased levels of social and economic deprivation would have smaller lists. While there would be many other issues to sort out it can’t be worse than now.&lt;/p&gt;

	The Academy Awards recently proposed a new category of Outstanding Achievement in Popular Film to reward the sort of multiplex releases that rarely win awards, only to hastily scrap the idea amid widespread derision. Multiplex-goers were to be catered for instead by the choice of the goofball comic Kevin Hart as the ceremony’s presenter on 25 February – except he had to step down amid controversy over his history of homophobic tweets. Mainstream tastes should be amply represented by nominations for &lt;em&gt;A Star Is Born&lt;/em&gt;, and by a likely Best Supporting Actor nod for Michael B Jordan for his charismatic turn as the villain Erik Killmonger in &lt;em&gt;Black Panther&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Alfonso Cuarón’s gorgeous &lt;em&gt;Roma&lt;/em&gt; is a possible Best Picture contender, which would represent the first non-documentary Oscar win for a Netflix production. Yorgos Lanthimos’s riotous period comedy &lt;em&gt;The Favourite&lt;/em&gt; (see opposite) should be in line for prizes, including Olivia Colman as Best Actress, a title she took at the Venice Film Festival last year. That category will find Lady Gaga in &lt;em&gt;A Star Is Born&lt;/em&gt; pitted against Glenn Close in &lt;em&gt;The Wife&lt;/em&gt;. Felicity Jones may be in the mix as Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in &lt;em&gt;On the Basis of Sex&lt;/em&gt; (8 February). My vote, if I had one, would go to Melissa McCarthy as the literary forger Lee Israel in &lt;em&gt;Can You Ever Forgive Me?&lt;/em&gt; (1 Feb).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Other big-hitters include &lt;em&gt;Green Book&lt;/em&gt; (1 Feb), a race-relations road movie with Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali, who won an Oscar for&lt;em&gt; Moonlight&lt;/em&gt;. The latter film’s director, Barry Jenkins, is back with an acclaimed adaptation of James Baldwin’s novel &lt;em&gt;If Beale Street Could Talk&lt;/em&gt; (8 Feb). &lt;em&gt;The Front Runner &lt;/em&gt;(11 Jan) has Hugh Jackman as the presidential candidate Gary Hart, while Christian Bale is vice-president Dick Cheney in &lt;em&gt;Vice &lt;/em&gt;(25 Jan).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Serious issues abound in three movies starring two young Oscar nominees: the drug-addiction dramas &lt;em&gt;Beautiful Boy&lt;/em&gt; (18 Jan) with Timothée Chalamet from &lt;em&gt;Call Me by Your Name&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Ben Is Back&lt;/em&gt; starring Lucas Hedges of &lt;em&gt;Manchester By the Sea &lt;/em&gt;fame alongside Julia Roberts. Hedges also plays a young gay man undergoing conversion therapy in &lt;em&gt;Boy Erased &lt;/em&gt;(8 Feb). The danger is that all these big, serious movies become indistinguishable. Anyone for &lt;em&gt;Beautiful Ben is Erased&lt;/em&gt;? &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-image-caption field-type-text field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;Black Panther&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

    <title>Olivia Colman film The Favourite is a vicious, rollicking period comedy</title>

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;
	Some way into the vicious, rollicking period comedy &lt;em&gt;The Favourite&lt;/em&gt;, Queen Anne (Olivia Colman) is trying to distract herself from a war with France that she still doesn’t quite understand. (“We must fight for…” – a pause, while she tries to remember the reason – “… what we fight for.”) She is sweet and giddy and transparently bonkers. She demands a pair of lobsters, announcing her intention to hold a race between them. The loser will be eaten, but then so will the winner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There’s no predicting what might pass for larks at court. We’ve already seen Whigs and Tories betting their frilly shirts on the fastest duck in the county, and a naked man being pelted with oranges. Anyone familiar with the director Yorgos Lanthimos’s singularly warped world may find themselves wondering who those crustaceans used to be; his first English-language film was called &lt;em&gt;The Lobster&lt;/em&gt;, after all, and it concerned people being turned into animals if they failed to find a mate within 45 days. Returning from that movie is Rachel Weisz, who plays Anne’s closest friend and adviser, Lady Sarah Churchill. Her influential position is threatened by the arrival of her cousin Abigail Hill (Emma Stone) as a&lt;br /&gt;
	servant. She wants very much to return to her own former aristocratic standing, even if it means using Sarah as a rung to be stepped on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Abigail’s plan seems initially to have scant chance of success. So intimate is Sarah with Anne that she can seize the monarch by the throat in a moment of discord without endangering their friendship. Sarah gains greatly from the relationship but there is warmth and sincerity in their rapport. When gout puts Anne in a wheelchair and a foul mood, it is only Sarah who knows – or dares – to whizz her around at high speed until she goes “Weeeeee!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Perhaps Sarah is also in charge of the camera, which is similarly given to careering along passageways, swivelling frenziedly and turning on a ducat. (In fact, the cinematographer is Robbie Ryan, who brings the fluidity and earthiness of his work with Andrea Arnold.) For master shots, Lanthimos adopts an extravagantly wide lens, sometimes even a fish-eye, to make the actors look stranded in their opulent high-ceilinged paradise. The film’s defiance of prim costume drama convention represents the visual equivalent of what Sofia Coppola did when she put punk and pop on the soundtrack of &lt;em&gt;Marie Antoinette&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Though the unhinged camerawork reflects the wild power struggle between Sarah and Abigail, that hint of volatility is more impressive when it’s integrated into the fabric of a scene, such as during Abigail’s night-time stroll with the Tory opposition leader Robert Harley (Nicholas Hoult), the first Earl of Oxford, who wears a wig in the shape of two upturned traffic cones, and wants her to be his spy. Their route is lined with, and lit by, rows of open torches, and it’s a breezy evening so the flames are licking greedily at the air. The scene gets its charge from the unpredictable fire, which brings a sense of spontaneity to the airless niche that Lanthimos has made for himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If this is his most satisfying film, that must be because the confines of the costume drama suit his taste for all things controlled. Part of the peculiar joke of &lt;em&gt;The Lobster &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;The Killing of a Sacred Deer&lt;/em&gt; lay in hearing A-list actors reciting their lines in the affectless manner of the casts of his early Greek-language films. Clearly this was a my-way-or-the-highway sort of director. His work in &lt;em&gt;The Favourite&lt;/em&gt; is looser and livelier, perhaps because the constraints he craves are there in the material already, be they literal (wigs, corsets, bandages) or dramatic (the endless seesawing of power and favour).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The picture’s vision of Queen Anne would be unimaginable without the precedent set on TV by Miranda Richardson’s comically petulant Elizabeth I in &lt;em&gt;Blackadder II&lt;/em&gt;. But the movie pushes the idea of the capricious monarch through the far reaches of comedy and almost into tragedy. Colman embodies sublimely the punch-drunk confusion of a woman unsure whether she’s child or adult, plaything or puppet-master. Her servants are ready with a spittoon for her to vomit into, though they would die rather than suggest that perhaps she’s scoffed enough blue cake for one day. That’s what makes Sarah special. “I will not lie,” she promises Anne. “That is love.” These women are playing a game so amorphous, though, that no one can prosper. The loser gets eaten, but then so does the winner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;The Favourite (15)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

	The universal man will be universally present in 2019. Leonardo da Vinci died on 2 May 1519 and the passage of five centuries has done nothing to decrease his appeal. Milan, where he lived from 1482 to 1499, will have no fewer than nine exhibitions to mark the half millennium, but the biggest and best shows of the Leonardo-fest will be in London and Paris.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Starting in February, 144 of his drawings from the Royal Collection, displaying the extraordinary range of his interests, will be on display simultaneously in batches of 12 in 12 locations around Britain (Belfast, Birmingham, Bristol, Cardiff, Glasgow, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, Sheffield, Southampton, Sunderland, plus one venue to be announced). The culmination of this regional diffusion will be “Leonardo da Vinci: A Life in Drawing” at the Queen’s Gallery, Buckingham Palace (24 May to 13 October); with more than 200 drawings it will be the largest display of his works for 65 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	After their London airing, 80 of the drawings will head to the Palace of Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh (22 November to 15 March 2020). Among the works on display for the first time will be two blank sheets that, under ultraviolet light, reveal a beautiful series of previously unknown studies of hands and horses’ heads, circa 1481.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Queen may own more than 550 sheets of Leonardo’s drawings (only the Biblioteca Ambrosiana in Milan has more) but the Louvre has nearly a third of his paintings. Whether we are in or out of Europe at that point, its major exhibition (24 October to 24 February 2020) will be worth braving passport control queues for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The other memorable date is the 350th anniversary of Rembrandt’s death. For the Dutch, needless to say, this is a big thing and the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam is beginning the year with a major show of all their holdings of his work (15 February-10 June) and ending it with a stellar pairing, “Rembrandt-Velázquez” (11 October – 19 January 2020). “Rembrandt and Saskia: Love in the Dutch Golden Age” at the Fries Museum Leeuwarden looks the pick of the other shows. Britain’s major galleries clearly prefer full centenaries and so are giving him a miss, leaving Dulwich Picture Gallery with “Rembrandt’s Light” (4 October to 2 February 2020) and the Holburne Museum in Bath (“Rembrandt in Print”, 4 October-&lt;br /&gt;
	5 January 2020) to fly the Dutch flag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In a year that promises a lot of post-1800 exhibitions and rather less in the way of old art, the Royal Academy is keeping one eye on its roots. It kicks off 2019 with the bizarre pairing of video artist with revered Renaissance man, “Bill Viola/Michelangelo” (26 January to 31 March). Both artists deal with the human figure and often elemental themes, but what links them beyond that (other than curatorial whim) will be intriguing to see. The RA follows this up with something less wilful, “The Renaissance Nude” (3 March to 2 June), which examines how Classical statuary sparked the age’s new interest in the human figure. It will offer premium works by the likes of Titian, Raphael, Dürer, Cranach and yes, both Michelangelo and Leonardo. The National Gallery’s sole major foray into the era comes with “Bartolomé Bermejo: Master of the Spanish Renaissance” (12 June to 29 September), a welcome look at a highly distinctive (think Bosch with added sheen) and little-known 15th-century figure from a country outside the artistic mainstream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;rtecenter&quot;&gt;
	&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;media-image attr__typeof__foaf:Image img__fid__100873 img__view_mode__media_large attr__format__media_large&quot; height=&quot;1417&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/2019_01_visual_arts_2.jpg?itok=MV_PaMTs&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; width=&quot;797&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bill Viola’s Fire Woman (2005)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It may be that Gabriele Finaldi, director of the National Gallery, is pining for his old job at the Prado in Madrid, but Spain figures again in the gallery’s major retrospective “Sorolla: Spanish Master of Light” (18 March to 7 July). Joaquín Sorolla y Bastida (1863–1923) had a bravura technique to match John Singer Sargent’s and also made both portraits and subject paintings: his sun-filled beach and fiesta scenes drip with Iberian glamour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	French sunlight accompanied by a large dose of chromatic and emotional intensity comes with “Pierre Bonnard: The Colour of Memory” (23 January to 6 May) at Tate Modern. Sensuous, melancholy, dreamlike and filled with his obsession with his wife, Marthe, Bonnard’s work is ripe for re-evaluation. Two of Bonnard’s contemporaries also receive an airing: Gauguin, 50 of whose portraits will be on display at the National Gallery (7 October to 26 January 2020) in the first ever show dedicated to this less celebrated side of his art, and the Swiss-French Félix Vallotton, painter of enigmatic interior psychodramas and often sinister landscapes (Royal Academy, 30 June to 29 September).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Gauguin’s sometime painting partner Van Gogh will be the focus of a major show at Tate Britain, “Van Gogh and Britain” (27 March to 11 August), courtesy of his two periods resident here as an art dealer and teacher in Stockwell in 1873 and Ramsgate and Isleworth in 1876. His sister-in-law said his time in south London was the happiest of his life and it will be a treat to see Van Gogh freed from the tyranny of sunflowers and the south of France.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Northern climes will also be in evidence in the British Museum’s “Edvard Munch: Love and Angst” (11 April to 21 July) and Dulwich Picture Gallery’s “Harald Sohlberg: Painting Norway” (13 February-2 June). The two painters knew each other and while Munch’s images of the uncertainty and pain of human existence became famous, Sohlberg has remained a Norwegian secret. His rich and richly symbolic landscapes – beautiful, mysterious and haunting – will be one of the revelations of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;rtecenter&quot;&gt;
	&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;media-image attr__typeof__foaf:Image img__fid__100874 img__view_mode__media_large attr__format__media_large&quot; height=&quot;970&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/2019_01_visual_arts_3.jpg?itok=8RaG94uO&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Van Gogh’s L’Arlésienne (1888)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The work of Jeff Koons and Keith Haring is more familiar, though rare on these shores. Koons will be showing a career-spanning selection of his works at the Ashmolean in Oxford (7 February-9 June) in a self-curated show that, appropriately for this most look-at-me of figures, wafts the sharp tang of a vanity project. Haring was the short-lived (he died aged 31 in 1990) third wheel of the Warhol-Basquiat jalopy and his grafitti-ish pictures did much to bring street art into the mainstream. This scion of the New York art scene will be transposed to Tate Liverpool (14 June to 10 November).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The year is rich too in hard-to-categorise talents. William Blake, who would surely be an internet sensation if he lived today, receives a major retrospective at Tate Britain (11 September to 2 February 2020). The Fitzwilliam in Cambridge, meanwhile, will offer a reminder of the brilliance of the pioneering late-19th-century brothers-in-law and graphic artists William Nicholson and James Pryde (7 May to 4 August). Their poster and book designs remain hugely influential (felt indeed by the mid-century linocutters Sybil Andrews, Claude Flight and Cyril Power – “Cutting Edge” at Dulwich Picture Gallery, 19 June to 8 September), though strangely underappreciated. The same could perhaps be said of David Bomberg, whose artistic formation is the theme of “Young Bomberg and the Old Masters” at the National Gallery (27 November to 1 March 2020).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A bright light will also be directed on an unusual aspect of Henry Moore’s work. He often suffers from familiarity but the Wallace Collection’s “Henry Moore: The Helmet Heads” (6 March-23 June) will show how Moore finessed visits to the collection’s armour holdings into a series of strikingly sinister graphic works. The light then swivels to Lucian Freud, whose self-portraits will be scrutinised at the Royal Academy (27 October to 26 January 2020).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As late 2018 showed, Paris is no stranger to unrest, and Louis-Léopold Boilly (1761-1845) lived through more than most – the revolution, Napoleon and the Bourbon restoration. “Boilly: Scenes of Parisian Life” (28 February to 19 May 2019) at the National Gallery will be filled by teeming vistas of that febrile period that repay nose-to-the-frame inspection. Boilly (also in evidence at the Wallace Collection, January-May) was no Leonardo but this French minor-master deserves his place in the sun too. &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--

	The pollster and commentator Peter Kellner feels I have been unfair &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/staggers/2019/01/are-peoples-vote-polls-loaded-no-says-peter-kellner&quot;&gt;in my characterisation&lt;/a&gt; of the People’s Vote campaign’s polls as been deliberately designed to achieve the most favourable pro-Remain response. Is he right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Kellner has three objections: the first is that in my comparison of two separate YouGov questions, one by the Economic and Social Research Council’s (ESRC) long-running study of party members, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/dfwqws5ghp/People&#039;sVoteResults_180919_LabMembers_w.pdf&quot;&gt;one by the People’s Vote campaign&lt;/a&gt;, I have omitted a third question by the ESRC that produces a result that is closer to that of the People’s Vote. The second is that none of the three questions can be fairly said to be “loaded” or designed to produce a certain response, and the third is that the three questions are too different from one another to be a useful point of comparison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I’ll take those in order. Today’s widely reported ESRC survey asks Labour party members the following question “Do you think Labour should or should not fully support holding a new referendum on Brexit?” to which 72 per cent of respondents said yes. I contrasted that with the People’s Vote question back in September 2018, which asked Labour activists “When the negotiations with the European Union about Brexit are complete, would you support or oppose a public vote on the outcome ?”, to which 86 per cent agreed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I have omitted &lt;em&gt;another &lt;/em&gt;question by the ESRC, which asked Labour members to “imagine that Parliament eventually votes to reject Mrs May’s proposed Brexit deal... Would you support or oppose holding a referendum on the deal if Parliament voted to reject the proposed Brexit deal?” to which 79 per cent agreed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I did this for two reasons. The first was that none of the coverage of the ERSC research cited the second figure (nor, for that matter, did the response of Best for Britain, one of the organisations that forms the People’s Vote campaign). I didn’t consider it to be all that useful to add a third question into the mix, not least because in both cases, the difference between the People’s Vote question is outside the margin of error (that’s plus or minus three per cent). Whichever question you use, there is a difference between the response to the ESRC’s survey and that conducted on behalf of the People’s Vote campaign.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	More importantly, I regard the ERSC’s question about whether to “fully support holding a new referendum on Brexit?” as &lt;em&gt;the &lt;/em&gt;essential question. When you boil it down, the central aim of the People’s Vote campaign is to have, effectively, a re-run of the last referendum in order to get a different result. That’s fine, and in my personal view highly desirable that Brexit is reversed or stopped by any democratic means available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But it is, by necessity, a narrower question than the one posed widely shared by the People’s Vote campaign in September, which simply asked whether people would support “a final vote on the outcome”. That could mean a far greater number of things: it could mean a vote on leaving with Theresa May’s deal or leaving with no deal at all: a vote that is obviously unacceptable to anyone wishing to remain in the European Union. It could mean a three-way vote between leaving with a deal, leaving without a deal, or staying in the European Union, which is unacceptable to anyone who believes that it is irresponsible to put the disruption and chaos of a no deal exit to a public vote. Or it could mean a referendum in which the choice is leaving on Theresa May’s terms or not leaving at all, a referendum which is unacceptable to many Leavers, who believe that would be a vote on two ways in which you are not &lt;em&gt;really &lt;/em&gt;leaving the European Union at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Self-evidently, if your opinion poll question allows &lt;em&gt;all &lt;/em&gt;of those possible outcomes to be contained within, you will get more support than you will if you choose a narrower question. The important question from a pro-European standpoint, however, is how to people feel about having another option to decide to stay in the European Union.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As to whether the questions are too different to be meaningful points of comparison, in my view, that one poll asks people what they &lt;em&gt;think &lt;/em&gt;the country should do and one poll asks what they think the leader of the party they are &lt;em&gt;literally a member of &lt;/em&gt;should do is a distinction without a difference, but I am prepared to accept that other people see it otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There is an open debate about whether the People’s Vote campaign is following best practice by asking its second vote questions at the end of a long series of questions about what Brexit means for both matters of national policy – the ease of ending austerity, for instance – and their families. Some pollsters believe that this influences responses unduly. Ed Miliband’s former pollster James Morris &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2015/05/late-swing-labours-private-polls-showed-tories-ahead-christmas&quot;&gt;found that the polls he conducted&lt;/a&gt; in which questions of voting intention following extensive questions about politics produced what turned out to be more accurate results. It’s too early to say conclusively whether or not this holds true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But that’s besides the point: it is, in my view, wholly legitimate for the People’s Vote campaign to use the most favourable questionnaire wording and structure it can to increase its prospects for securing the referendum re-run it craves. But it is not accurate to do as Kellner does and claim that there is “no evidence” that the campaign’s choice of questions has an impact on the answers it receives.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--

	Stephen Bush accuses the People’s Vote campaign of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/elections/2019/01/there-s-something-everyone-has-missed-about-polls-and-people-s-vote&quot;&gt;asking “deliberately loaded questions”&lt;/a&gt; about Brexit without offering any evidence for his charge. This is not surprising for there is no such evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Bush compares two findings from different YouGov polls of Labour Party members, one funded by the Economic and Social Research Council, the other by the People’s Vote Campaign. (Respondents are not told the identity of the client: all they see are the questions themselves.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In fact, there are three questions that can be compared: two from the ESRC survey, one from the People’s Vote survey. Bush omits the third question; had he done so, his case would have been undermined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Here are the three questions, whose wording Bush failed to provide, together with the percentages of Labour Party members giving a pro-referendum response:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;ESRC 1 (cited by Bush):&lt;/strong&gt; Do you think Labour should or should not fully support holding a new referendum on Brexit? &lt;em&gt;(72 per cent yes)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;ESRC 2 (not cited by Bush):&lt;/strong&gt; Imagine that Parliament eventually votes to reject Mrs May’s proposed Brexit deal... Would you support or oppose holding a referendum on the deal if Parliament voted to reject the proposed Brexit deal? &lt;em&gt;(79 per cent yes)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;People’s Vote poll:&lt;/strong&gt; When the negotiations with the European Union about Brexit are complete, would you support or oppose a public vote on the outcome? &lt;em&gt;(86 per cent yes) &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Had Bush actually provided the wording of all three questions, his readers would have seen:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;
		None of the questions is “loaded”, deliberately or otherwise. This is not surprising: YouGov has its own reputation to defend, and rightly insists on unbiased questions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li value=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
		The three questions are in fact different: one is about how Labour should act, one about a respondents’ own views on a referendum on the Withdrawal Agreement, and one (posed some weeks earlier) about a public vote when the negotiations are complete. It’s as if one question had been: do you like oranges?; another: do you like apples?; a third, do you like pears?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li value=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
		The striking thing is not how different the responses are, but how similar. In each case, if we exclude don’t knows (as is normal in reporting voting intention polls), pro-referendum responses reach 80 per cent or more, and outnumber anti-referendum responses by at least four-to-one. By any standards, these are conclusive margins.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	All this is in the public domain: YouGov, applying transparency rules that I helped to write some years ago, reports the full wording of, and data from, these Brexit surveys. Had Bush been as equally transparent, he would have revealed the weakness of his case. Was his a “deliberately loaded” blog? You may very well think so; I couldn’t possibly comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

    <title>When song lyrics become literature</title>

	From Pet Shop Boys to Kate Bush, pop stars are publishing their songs as books. What do their words reveal about them?&lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-node-image field-type-image field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;noscript class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoints=&quot;300 768 1024&quot; data-adaptive-image-300-img=&quot;&amp;lt;img class=&amp;quot;adaptive-image&amp;quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&amp;quot;300&amp;quot; typeof=&amp;quot;foaf:Image&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/lead_image/public/Longreads_2019/01/2019_01_song_lyrics.jpg?itok=pYKLBTZ0&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&quot; data-adaptive-image-768-img=&quot;&amp;lt;img class=&amp;quot;adaptive-image&amp;quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&amp;quot;768&amp;quot; typeof=&amp;quot;foaf:Image&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/lead_image/public/Longreads_2019/01/2019_01_song_lyrics.jpg?itok=pYKLBTZ0&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&quot; data-adaptive-image-1024-img=&quot;&amp;lt;img class=&amp;quot;adaptive-image&amp;quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&amp;quot;1024&amp;quot; typeof=&amp;quot;foaf:Image&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/lead_image/public/Longreads_2019/01/2019_01_song_lyrics.jpg?itok=pYKLBTZ0&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&quot; data-adaptive-image-max-img=&quot;&amp;lt;img class=&amp;quot;adaptive-image&amp;quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&amp;quot;max&amp;quot; typeof=&amp;quot;foaf:Image&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/lead_image/public/Longreads_2019/01/2019_01_song_lyrics.jpg?itok=pYKLBTZ0&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&quot;&gt;&lt;img typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/Longreads_2019/01/2019_01_song_lyrics.jpg?itok=3vb2RbsS&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;
	What happens to a song lyric when it lands on the page? It becomes oddly silent but also not silent. Ghosts of its usual rhythms lie at the beginnings and ends of its lines. The blank space around it seems weirdly disconcerting, like white noise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This happens, of course, because a song lyric isn’t poetry. A poem exists between pages of paper, bound by its own internal logic. A lyric arrives from the wider world, laden with decades of meaning and remembered melody, and is unmoored violently and suddenly from its bearings. It is also presented for the reader’s eye – which implies an act of choice – not the listener’s ear. The ear could have heard an unforgettable lyric quite by chance on an otherwise ordinary morning. This serendipity disappears in print, although we still hunt for magic within these new leaves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Books of collected song lyrics are now big business, especially the elegantly designed, expensively produced kind. This phenomenon was kick-started by Faber &amp;amp; Faber in 2011, when it put Jarvis Cocker into a suitably vintage-looking, brown-and-yellow dust-jacket. The typeface spelling out his name deliberately echoed the publisher’s poetry list too, reflecting the status songwriters such as Cocker have gained in popular culture. And why not? Pop music is a distinguished pensioner now with a solid canon: only a hoary naysayer would argue that Bob Dylan’s catalogue of affecting narrative and acute social analysis lacked the cultural heft to be awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2016. (Sappho, Pindar and co were writing short songs about emotional states millennia ago, bashing away at their lyres, and calling them lyrics. They would have released them on limited-edition marbled vinyl if they could.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The publishing industry is also responding to a nostalgic, middle-aged market, of course, for whom pop musicians were once guides and sages, offering intelligent insights into new worlds through an accessible, approachable medium. Actually, who am I kidding? For most grown-ups, they still are, especially in a culture scrabbling about for articulate heroes. Nevertheless, a tension on the page still remains, which Dylan noted in his Nobel speech in June 2017: “Songs are unlike literature… our songs are alive in the land of the living.” By implication, this means something dies when the lyric gets severed, a sentiment that Neil Tennant echoes introducing his book, &lt;em&gt;One Hundred Lyrics and A Poem&lt;/em&gt;. “This is not the natural habitat of the song lyric,” he declares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Before fame, Tennant was an editor for Marvel Comics and &lt;em&gt;Smash Hits&lt;/em&gt;, where, he continues, he learnt about “editing text to make it clearer and more focused… I could apply this to song lyrics and the songwriting process as a whole”. This approach sounds oddly unromantic, and the mood it creates affects the lyrics that follow, as fabulous, sophisticated and melancholy phrases frequently fall with similar coldness on the page. Take 1985’s &lt;em&gt;West End Girls&lt;/em&gt;, the song that made Tennant famous at 30, inspired by the many voices of TS Eliot’s &lt;em&gt;The Waste Land&lt;/em&gt;. The couplet “if when why what/How much have you got?” sounds like a perfect analysis of Thatcherism when it’s delivered in an upwardly mobile accent holding shadows of the singer’s native North Shields. On the page, it falls with surprising heaviness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Throughout, Tennant’s precise Englishness requires something bolder to offset its simplicity: you miss fellow Pet Shop Boy Chris Lowe’s neon-lit synthesisers, and those turbo-charged disco pulses. Tennant also orders his 100 lyrics alphabetically, which seems an oddly offhand way of dealing with them. It’s a method the American singer-songwriter Will Oldham also uses for his blue-and-gold-embossed collection, &lt;em&gt;Songs of Love and Horror&lt;/em&gt; (WW Norton, 304pp, £16.99), adding brief biographical footnotes, like Tennant, after each lyric. His book was more fascinating for me because I knew fewer of the songs. Perhaps the way a fan shapes their own life within a favoured writer’s lyrics is the real problem here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To work well for the true devotee, a lyric book has to be something other than a simple compendium. An abstracted, artistic version of memoir, perhaps. When these elements creep into Tennant’s book it gains an extra dimension. His mentions of the socialist-inspired, amateur theatre company that got him interested in writing when he was a teenager are fascinating; he also did once tell a lover “You Only Tell Me You Love Me When You’re Drunk”, as the song from 2000 goes. He discusses the the way words sound too: the title of 1990’s “Being Boring” came from a non-plussed Japanese review (“I liked the bouncy rhythm of this phrase”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Tennant’s lyrics work best on record when they surprise, as they did me at the age of ten when I heard the line “Che Guevara and Debussy to a disco beat” in “Left To My Own Devices”, just before the song exploded into pop. It’s apt, then, that the best part of the book is surprising too. This is the poem that ends it: four simple, devastating lines about the unknown-ness of the ends of our lives (no spoilers, but it’s worth the price tag alone). It proves he’s a good lyricist after all, understanding the power of the unexpected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	No one knows this better than Kate Bush, the first woman to be added to Faber &amp;amp; Faber’s roster of lyricists (Jarvis Cocker, Billy Bragg, Van Morrison and Scott Walker preceded her; the Happy Mondays’ Auden-on-acid Shaun Ryder follows in the spring). Her book, unlike Tennant’s, works magically, possibly because many of her lyrics are structured so strangely. She also adds, in her brief author’s note: “all the lyrics have been reviewed as works of verse without their music and so in some places are more detailed than how they originally appeared on their albums”. Some digging on my part reveals nothing more than her playing with poetical constructions such as “o’er”. To do this job properly, however, weeks of album listening will be required, promoting a deeper understanding of these songs. Bush clearly knows what she’s doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;How To Be Invisible&lt;/em&gt; also sees Bush grouping her songs, without explaining her methods; it’s your job to spot the golden threads connecting these pages. Here are songs about clouds (“Cloudbusting”, “The Big Sky”, “You Want Alchemy”), drifting in and out with wonder. Here are songs explicitly and obliquely about war (“Pull Out the Pin”, “Breathing”, “Experiment IV”). “Army Dreamers” is also in this set, one of many that reads astonishingly on paper. A number 16 hit in 1980, its lyric about a dead soldier reminds you of the brutal economy of Sylvia Plath: “Now he’s sitting in his hole,” runs the most devastating line. “He might as well have buttons and bows.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Themes recur at mystical intervals too. The rope that ties lovers together in “Sat In Your Lap” appears, like a ghost, in “Snowed In At Wheeler Street” (songs from 1981 and 2011 respectively; their dates are not listed in the book). The second-side song cycles from &lt;em&gt;Hounds of Love&lt;/em&gt; (1985) and &lt;em&gt;Aerial&lt;/em&gt; (2005) – “The Ninth Wave” and “A Sky of Honey” respectively – also incorporate pages that go beyond conventional text (the voices murmuring to the drowning woman in “The Ninth Wave” dance across a double-page spread in different typefaces; while in “A Sky of Honey” birdsong is depicted in skittish, angled handwriting). Here is an artist still expanding the possibilities of a form, as she always has.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In &lt;em&gt;Useless Magic: Lyrics and Poetry&lt;/em&gt;, Florence Welch of Florence and the Machine also doffs her jaunty beret towards Bush. “Babooshka” is listed on a tatty sheet of graph paper as one of her favourite songs early on. As the book takes us forward in time, and Welch’s fame grows, her scribbles progress to Chateau Marmont hotel notepaper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This is very much a self-conscious, over-ripe young person’s scrapbook. Pictures of Virginia Woolf and Patti Smith are plonked next to lists of pros and cons about seeing a boy at a party (“he will remember how much he likes you”, “she could be there”). Nevertheless, this adds a refreshingly honest intensity to the exercise, as do ideas for lyrics such as: “We were getting ready to go out/the excitement a firework in my mouth.” The inclusion of Welch’s frequent misspellings (her religious cross is a “crusefix”, her plural of sky “sky’s”) also make no apology of her flaws, and her attempts at poems are of varying quality, as she herself admits. The last one is great, though, simply called “I Cannot Write About This”. “Now it is altogether/Too grown up/Too sad/Too ‘the best for us both’/To put into poetry,” she writes, sadly, nailing the slipperiness of language, and how much we demand of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But songwriters keep wrestling with this to the end, as did Leonard Cohen. His final collection, &lt;em&gt;The Flame&lt;/em&gt;, reveals a man keeping on keeping on until his dying days. In a moving introduction, his son Adam recalls discovering notebooks in his dad’s pockets, drawers, and in the freezer one day as he was searching for tequila. Cohen worked tirelessly on his poems and songs for years. This is someone who still thought of his most famous song, “Hallelujah”, as unfinished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	So how unexpectedly lovely it is that one of the most moving things in this book is an email exchange between Cohen and his friend Peter Scott, a Canadian poet. It’s like a rap battle almost, two old dears contesting the idea of darkness in lower-case letters: “he will make it darker/he will make it light/according to his torah/which leonard did not write,” Cohen retorts, playfully. He died a month later, but his words keep on living. Our job is to take them elsewhere, off the page, and onwards with us. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;
	Hallam Tennyson was in many ways a traditional literary executor. He saw his duty as guarding privacy, sustaining an image. When his father – Poet Laureate, peer of the realm, favourite of Queen Victoria – died in 1892, he wrote a cagey two-volume biographical memoir, after destroying many of its source materials, including the journal kept by his mother, Emily. As John Batchelor explains, in an essay in the new &lt;em&gt;Companion to Literary Biography&lt;/em&gt;, no reference was made to Alfred Tennyson’s chaotic upbringing, his sexual passion for his Lincolnshire neighbour Rosa Baring, the scruffy friends he cultivated during his nomadic years in the 1830s and 1840s. “Any stories which deviated from Emily Tennyson’s own pious view of her husband and her family had to be pushed to one side.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But for all the extremity of the whitewash, this was a fairly typical move. Passages of Shelley’s work had been bowdlerised by his widow; Cassandra Austen had burned most of her sister’s letters. It was also prudent: tell-all accounts – expressions of what the novelist Margaret Oliphant called the “cynic principle” – had overshadowed the posthumous careers of Robert Burns and Thomas Carlyle. (The “new biography”, anti-Victorian in style and spirit, of Lytton Strachey, Edmund Gosse, Harold Nicolson and Virginia Woolf, would only vindicate Hallam’s tendency towards censorship.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It was Hallam’s later actions that mark him out as the first modern executor. Having produced a popular edition, &lt;em&gt;The Works of Tennyson&lt;/em&gt;, for Macmillan, he donated Tennyson’s manuscripts and notebooks to Trinity College, Cambridge, with an accompanying ban on all quotation and the copying of anything but “short notes”. Editions listing textual variants – draft versions etc – had “spoilt Wordsworth” for his father, he explained. Yet the reasons were not exclusively literary. Hallam was the beneficiary of his father’s possessions and also of his intellectual property. By producing his own edition while preventing others, he extended his family’s sole claim to royalties, an effort aided in 1911, when the term of copyright was extended to 50 years after an author’s death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In a preference repeated down the decades, Hallam Tennyson suppressed factual accuracy and scholarly completism in favour of commerce and the common reader. It was a divide that only broadened as the century progressed: the unsolicited biographer and tireless “bibliomaniac” – Hallam’s term of disapproval – didn’t stand a chance against Broadway and TV, the multiplex and the paperback. Peter Ackroyd, writing his 1984 biography of TS Eliot, was prevented from quoting his subject’s unpublished writing and even his published work “except for purposes of fair comment in a critical context”, on the ground that Eliot asked his executors not “to facilitate or countenance” a project of this kind. Meanwhile, Andrew Lloyd Webber’s &lt;em&gt;Cats&lt;/em&gt; played at the New London Theatre and New York’s Winter Garden, in the face of Eliot’s desire not to have his poems set to music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	At the height of “&lt;em&gt;Brideshead&lt;/em&gt; fever”, sparked by the 1981 Granada TV production of &lt;em&gt;Brideshead Revisited&lt;/em&gt;, the academic and would-be biographer Martin Stannard battled with Evelyn Waugh’s spiteful and forgetful son Auberon. As Stannard recalls in his superb essay “Estate Management”, also collected in the &lt;em&gt;Companion&lt;/em&gt;, the younger Waugh charged extortionate permission fees for quoting from Waugh’s writing and papers, and then blocked Stannard from writing an introduction to &lt;em&gt;The Loved One&lt;/em&gt;. “Do I take it that I shall never be allowed to ‘edit’ or to quote extensively from his writings?” Stannard asked at one point. “As a scholar who has devoted his entire professional life to the study of Evelyn Waugh, this would come as a mortal blow.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Stannard is keen to emphasise the sheer vulnerability of anyone seeking the favour of a literary estate: “It remains, whatever anyone might proclaim about free speech and open scholarship, a relation between one in power and a supplicant. The privileges can be withdrawn at any moment, ‘access’ denied.”(Although archives are purchased for vast sums by institutions such as the Harry Ransom Center in Texas, there’s no guarantee that visiting scholars will receive clearance to quote their findings.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In most cases where a biographer has butted heads with an executor or living subject, there is some kind of response from the losing side: Ackroyd has stuck to the long-dead (Dickens, Blake, Shakespeare) and non-living (London, Venice, the Thames); Stannard, following a second bruising experience – that time with Muriel Spark – retreated into academic life. The American writer Lee Israel was more boisterous. The author of a well-regarded book on Tallulah Bankhead, Israel – who died in 2014 – found her reputation in tatters when a biography of Estée Lauder, commissioned in the early 1980s, became a horrible rush job following Lauder’s announcement that she would be writing a book of her own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Having plummeted “from best-sellerdom to welfare” – as she puts it, in the jaunty memoir &lt;em&gt;Can You Ever Forgive Me?&lt;/em&gt; – Israel resolved to make ends meet with what looks like a form of symbolic thwarted-biographer’s revenge: using stolen or specially commissioned hotel stationery and second-hand vintage typewriters, she began forging dozens of literary letters, which she sold to unscholarly or unscrupulous New York book dealers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Israel’s forgeries drew heavily on someone who had previously stymied biographers’ efforts – the playwright Lillian Hellman, a fierce executor of her husband, Dashiell Hammett, and of her friend Dorothy Parker. Israel’s source for the Hellman imitations was a letter she had herself received refusing to grant an interview for the Bankhead book (“she was a difficult woman: happily, her signature was easy”). But it wasn’t only an example of the biographer biting back, it was also an exercise in imaginative biographical homage. One of the fake Hellman letters renders with sympathy behaviour that Israel herself considered “possessive and proprietary”: “Dottie Parker… did not wish to allow a biography… I gave a promise when she was ill. I have, of course, even as the executrix, no legal right to forbid such an endeavour, but I have a moral obligation to tell you her wish.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;rtecenter&quot;&gt;
	****&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The 1980s were the high-water mark of the biographer’s travails. Life-writing was at its most popular, thanks mainly to books such as Michael Holroyd’s &lt;em&gt;Lytton Strachey &lt;/em&gt;(1967) that had delivered their revelations after suffering little interference. But estates and living subjects were also at their most aggressively territorial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As Ackroyd, Stannard and Israel suffered their setbacks, the poet Ian Hamilton was in the process of turning himself into a cautionary tale and a legal precedent. Having been predictably denied co-operation by the eremitic JD Salinger (“Don’t do this to me,” he pleaded), Hamilton was then prohibited from quoting three caches of correspondence that he had discovered. “Fair use” – the doctrine governing unpermitted quotation of copyrighted material – “had taken a bad knock”, Hamilton later wrote of a case that reached the US Appeals Court in 1987. “So too had paraphrase. Copyright law might never be the same again.” (One of the things that keeps biographers such as Stannard, Israel and Hamilton ploughing on is the fact of having received, and partly spent, an advance.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	“It’s as if he’s pronounced himself dead and then appointed himself literary executor,” Hamilton said. Stung but not cowed, he recounted his troubles in the final pages of his book, &lt;em&gt;In Search of JD Salinger &lt;/em&gt;(1988), bemoaning the injustice, and then published &lt;em&gt;Keepers of the Flame &lt;/em&gt;(1992), a survey of literary estates that formed part of a new discipline, still unnamed in English (the Germans call it &lt;em&gt;nachlebenstudien&lt;/em&gt;), which considers what happens to dead writers, either at the hands of executors or exegetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	At first, afterlife study was a kind of scholarly solipsism, a reflection on the theory and genealogy of the author’s own professional activities. Michael Millgate, the author of the case studies in &lt;em&gt;Testamentary Acts &lt;/em&gt;(1992), published the same year as Hamilton’s book, had written a study of Thomas Hardy’s career and a biography as well as presiding over his collected letters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The adventures of William Shakespeare since 1616 (the First Folio, David Garrick’s “Jubilee” celebrations in 1769, the Romantic cult, the authorship debate, the futile attacks on “Bardolatry”) were treated by specialists such as Jonathan Bate, in &lt;em&gt;Shakespearean Constitutions&lt;/em&gt; (1989) and &lt;em&gt;The Genius of Shakespeare&lt;/em&gt; (1997), and Gary Taylor, in &lt;em&gt;Reinventing Shakespeare&lt;/em&gt; (1989), and by “cultural materialist” critics eager to expose Shakespeare as a “sponge” of meanings, and a “tool” of power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Since then, there have been book-length inquiries on virtually all the English (or Anglo-American) writers who have led notably active critical and biographical afterlives: the Brontës, CS Lewis, DH Lawrence, George Orwell, Henry James – a writer himself preoccupied, in stories such as “The Aspern Papers” (1888), with the subject of literary estates – and in particular Jane Austen, whose fame, cults, textual lives, the ways she was “made”, “used” and “recreated” have been the subject of a series of studies since the beginning of the century, a whole discipline shifting from from the study of “Jane” to the study of earlier “Janeites”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Most of these books were written by academics and published by university presses, but popular forms such as narrative history and long-form journalism are well-placed to deal with afterlives that have played out in public – on stage and in courtrooms as opposed to, say, the correspondence columns of the&lt;em&gt; Times Literary Supplement&lt;/em&gt; or the corridors of the Oxford University Press.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Michael Holroyd, writing in the same year as Hamilton and Millgate, added a whole volume to his biography of George Bernard Shaw. Janet Malcolm, in her magisterial non-fiction novella &lt;em&gt;In the Freud Archives &lt;/em&gt;(1984), investigated a case that she likened to “The Aspern Papers”, and then, in &lt;em&gt;The Silent Woman: Sylvia Plath and Ted Hughes&lt;/em&gt; (1994), explored perhaps the most notorious of all literary estates through two further beleaguered 1980s biographies: Linda Wagner-Martin’s &lt;em&gt;Sylvia Plath: a Biography &lt;/em&gt;(1987), which was completed in spite of objections from Hughes and his sister Olwyn, who served as Plath’s executor, and Anne Stevenson’s &lt;em&gt;Bitter Fame &lt;/em&gt;(1989), which was deemed too deferential to an estate whose help the author freely acknowledged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;rtecenter&quot;&gt;
	&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;media-image attr__typeof__foaf:Image img__fid__100866 img__view_mode__media_large attr__format__media_large&quot; height=&quot;1014&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/2019_01_emily_dickinson.jpg?itok=7Z80TEjQ&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Emily Dickinson left nearly 2,000 poems​&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Now Benjamin Balint, in the gripping and knotty &lt;em&gt;Kafka’s Last Trial&lt;/em&gt;, and Julie Dobrow, in the angering but finally inspiring &lt;em&gt;After Emily&lt;/em&gt;, lay bare the relationship between estate management, archival avarice, popular renown, and inheritance law. Both books consider bodies of work that were constituted posthumously. Franz Kafka asked for his unpublished papers to be burnt, a request ignored by his friend Max Brod, who spent the rest of his life, in Balint’s words, “canonising Kafka as the most prescient – and most disquieting – chronicler of the 20th century”. Brod himself called his actions: “the helping of a friend even against the wish of the friend”. (Gratitude for these efforts hasn’t always been forthcoming: JM Coetzee noted that Brod “utterly failed to understand” Kafka’s work; Milan Kundera called his behaviour “the model for disobedience to dead friends”.) Emily Dickinson’s sister, meanwhile, burned a lot of personal correspondence (that’s what sisters are for) but all of the nearly 2,000 poems discovered in Emily’s bedroom, many of them bound by twine into fascicles, eventually found their way into book form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The editing of Dickinson’s poetry occurred in two distinct periods. First, during the 1890s, Mabel Loomis Todd, the lover of Dickinson’s brother, edited two volumes that sold well (the publisher invoked “Hot Cakes”). Decades later, Todd unlocked a camphorwood chest full of poems she withheld after falling out with the Dickinson family. In the process, she set her ambitious daughter, Millicent Todd Bingham, on a lifetime of deciphering what Mabel called “the strangest hand ever seen” and of fighting with the next Dickinson generation about who owned the original manuscripts and which institution should buy them. Throughout it all, Millicent remembered her priorities: “This thing is bigger than a dispute between Amherst and Harvard over legal technicalities. It is a question of a correct text for the standard edition – the permanent form in which the poems of Emily Dickinson will be known from now on.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A similar story is played out in Balint’s book. Esther Hoffe, Max Brod’s secretary, had been a daughter figure to him and, after he died in 1968, his heir. Brod left her his papers and seems to have asked for them to be given on her death to the National Library of Israel. Esther, believing them to be her personal property, decided to sell them instead to the German Literary Archives, in Marbach. The question of whether Esther was an executor or beneficiary has been the subject of a succession of court cases held in Israel. Should her daughter, Eva, have inherited things that Brod had left to her mother or should they have “reverted” to something that might be more neutrally recognised as “the Brod estate”? Did Brod even have a right to the manuscripts in the first place, at any rate the one he had taken from Kafka’s desk?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Other subjects of debate included Kafka’s attitude to Judaism and Zionism, Israel’s attitude to Kafka, Brod, and German-language literature, and Kafka’s attitude to Germany. Kafka’s biographer, Reiner Stach, pointed out that in Israel there is neither a complete edition of Kafka’s works – even the German edition wasn’t held by the library seeking to house the original manuscripts – nor a single street named after him. But then had Esther’s use of her veto over Brod’s archive – 20,000 pages in all – been responsible for the comparative lack of Kafka scholarship? One judge suggested that the relevant question was not whether the library employed the relevant experts but if it had the requisite space and resources. Clearly, whatever Kafka’s misgivings about the German nation, he loved German literature and language. But the case was being heard in Israel – and the Supreme Court ruled in favour of the National Library in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	During the trials, the indeterminacy of Kafka’s writing – central to his reputation, the reason why anyone would want to own his papers – was transformed by archive fever into a source of legal frustration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But then estates have always been a liberal breeder of paradox and peripeteia. JD Salinger, by imposing his copyright on the letters found by Ian Hamilton, rendered them available for public inspection, as well as quotation by newspapers covering the trial, and also subjected himself to more scrutiny and attention than Hamilton’s book could ever have generated on its own. A biography of Hamilton himself was abandoned after his widow refused to cooperate. Jonathan Bate, one of the masters of &lt;em&gt;nachlebenstudien&lt;/em&gt;, fell foul of the Ted Hughes estate, after his authorised biography was deemed too prurient, more concerned with Hughes’s libido than with his “imagination”. Two of Lee Israel’s Noël Coward fakes made it into in a 2007 edition of his letters, 15 years after her arrest. Martin Stannard is currently overseeing a complete critical edition of Evelyn Waugh’s work. History moves in improbable directions, outwitting efforts at plotting and planning, as developments in the Hallam Tennyson story show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;rtecenter&quot;&gt;
	****&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Michael Millgate, in &lt;em&gt;Testamentary Acts&lt;/em&gt;, wrote that Hallam was seeking to propel his father’s reputation “securely forward into an infinite future”. In reality, the &lt;em&gt;Memoir&lt;/em&gt; was motivated by a Victorian vision of piety and politesse, and the Trinity bequest was based on the recognition that popular poets were able to thrive in popular editions, unburdened by scholarly apparatus. But what if piety fell out of fashion and every poet had a scholarly edition of his or her own? What if the general reader craved biographical scandal and academic attention – far from spoiling the reader’s experience – became a writer’s best chance of survival?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For a long time, Hallam’s desire to stymie scholarship prevailed. Christopher Ricks’s 1969 Longman edition of Tennyson’s poems contained repeated reference to “Trinity MS, which may not be quoted”. But later in 1969, the 3rd Baron Tennyson, Hallam’s son, lifted the restriction. Ricks’s revised Longman edition (1987) expanded to three volumes; “Trinity MS, released from interdiction” made frequent appearances. Ricks’s edition did more than anything else to bolster the revival of interest in Tennyson’s poems, revealing the care that had gone into their rewriting. This came at a time of greater interest in literary revision, as displayed in ongoing editing projects at Yale concerning the recently discovered papers of James Boswell; at Cornell concerning the manuscripts of Wordsworth – which had been microfilmed and distributed in case the Lake District suffered a nuclear attack; and in the publication of the original drafts of Eliot’s poem “The Waste Land”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Valerie Eliot was, for many years, an executor in the Hallam Tennyson mould – restricting access to correspondence, dooming biographers to digest. Apart from “The Waste Land” manuscript, a book of lectures, and a collection of the letters Eliot had written until the age of 34, nothing had appeared in the three decades following the poet’s death in 1965. Then, in 1996, at Valerie’s invitation, Christopher Ricks brought out &lt;em&gt;Inventions of the March Hare&lt;/em&gt;, based on a notebook of early unpublished poems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In his second edition of Tennyson’s poems, Ricks had explained the shift in policy by saying that the third Lord Tennyson had wisely chosen “one form of piety over another” – respect for the poems over respect for the wishes of the poet as construed by his son. The Eliot case was harder. Eliot had insisted that no “academic critic” should edit his work. Ricks’s reply was that notes had become more necessary with time, and that Eliot “sometimes applauded an annotated edition”. It’s not a strong argument: Eliot was himself aware, when he set down his request, that a poem’s context tends to fade and that he had himself applauded, for example, FL Lucas’s four-volume edition of Webster. Sensing perhaps the element of illogic, Ricks produced the trump card, the all-powerful claim that Valerie Eliot must be accounted “the best judge of what her husband would have wished in changed cultural circumstances” – not, he was careful to say, what her husband really meant, but what he would have wanted were he alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Had circumstances changed so much in the 15 years after Eliot’s death to allow for &lt;em&gt;Cats&lt;/em&gt;, despite his ban on rendering his poem as songs, or in 30 years to make poems he considered “unpublishable” worthy of a hardback of their own? A more honest and convincing justification might be that live interests and living readers and students – not to mention untapped royalties – carry more weight than the desires expressed by dead authors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Ricks would have seemed an unlikely favourite of the Eliot estate. Writing in this magazine in 1963, he had quipped that Eliot defending Wyndham Lewis against the charge of fascist sympathies was like the pot calling the kettle white. But it wasn’t Ricks’s subsequent apology that redeemed him. It was his scholarship, the work he did as an “academic critic”. After a lecture, Valerie Eliot approached Ricks and said: “Tom would have loved your edition of Tennyson.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The stories of literary estates testify for the most part to the futility of legislating for posterity – of seeking to determine, from a fixed point in time and single point of view, what will prove to be “best” for a writer’s personal or critical reputation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It is pleasingly ironic that activities conducted in opposition to the original desires of one executor (Hallam Tennyson) helped to loosen the strictures of another (Valerie Eliot). But even more typical of the ways in which literary history punishes hubris and undermines prophecy is that an edition so at odds with how Hallam Tennyson believed his father’s work should be preserved could have led so directly to the publication, in 2015, of Ricks’s next commission, &lt;em&gt;The Poems of TS Eliot: The Annotated Text&lt;/em&gt;. Edited with Jim McCue, the two-volume edition carries note after note concerning Eliot’s debts to the poetry of Tennyson, to “Maud” and “The Princess” and “In Memoriam”, thereby helping to affirm his position as the dominant and most influential English poet of the later 19th century well into the 21st.&lt;/p&gt;

	How do you like your Arthur Miller? Whatever the answer, 2019 has a production for you. Perhaps it’s the Trump effect: in London, the neuroses, pathologies and myths of America will be unavoidable this year. Kicking off is David Suchet’s turn in &lt;strong&gt;The Price&lt;/strong&gt; at the Wyndham’s Theatre in the West End, a transfer from Theatre Royal Bath (opening night: 11 February). Then the well-regarded US director Rachel Chavkin (&lt;em&gt;Hadestown&lt;/em&gt;) takes &lt;strong&gt;The American Clock&lt;/strong&gt; to the Old Vic (5 February). Two months later, the same venue is producing a starry version of&lt;strong&gt; All My Sons&lt;/strong&gt;, with US actors Sally Field and Bill Pullman, plus &lt;em&gt;Victoria&lt;/em&gt;’s Jenna Coleman and &lt;em&gt;Merlin&lt;/em&gt;’s Colin Morgan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In May, Marianne Elliott (&lt;em&gt;Company&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Angels in America&lt;/em&gt;) directs an all-black cast in &lt;strong&gt;Death of a Salesman&lt;/strong&gt; at the Young Vic. It features Wendell Pierce – Bunk from&lt;em&gt; The Wire&lt;/em&gt; – and Sharon Clarke, currently shining in the lead role in Tony Kushner’s &lt;em&gt;Caroline, or Change&lt;/em&gt;, plus emerging star Arinzé Kene, whose one-man show &lt;em&gt;Misty &lt;/em&gt;was a such a hit at the Bush Theatre that he became only the second black British playwright to have a show on in the West End.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The man who beat him there is Kwame Kwei-Armah, now the artistic director of the Young Vic. He is clearly a big fan of &lt;em&gt;The Wire&lt;/em&gt;, because his first season also features a collaboration with Idris Elba, who played the drama’s erudite drug lord Stringer Bell. It’s a music-led piece called &lt;strong&gt;Tree &lt;/strong&gt;based around Elba’s album &lt;em&gt;Mi Mandela&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The changing face of London theatre will be obvious, after last year’s rash of artistic director vacancies. Lynette Linton heads to the Bush after directing an all women-of-colour version of &lt;strong&gt;Richard II&lt;/strong&gt; at the Globe in February. Roxana Silbert takes over at the Hampstead Theatre in late 2019, after directing a play based on Khaled Hosseini’s novel &lt;strong&gt;A Thousand Splendid Suns&lt;/strong&gt; at her current home, the Birmingham Rep, in May.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	At Actors Touring Company, Matthew Xia replaces Ramin Gray, who left under a cloud (and whose exit prompted the resignations of three of the board). In March, Xia directs Athol Fugard’s 1961 play &lt;strong&gt;Blood Knot&lt;/strong&gt;, set in apartheid South Africa, at the teeny Orange Tree Theatre in Richmond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Elsewhere, Lotte Wakeham joins the Bolton Octagon after eight years at the Royal Shakespeare Company, and Suba Das, currently at the Curve in Leicester, moves to HighTide in East Anglia. (The 2018 artistic director transfer market gave luvvies a small taste of the excitement of following football.) One of the few white men to get a big promotion last year was Michael Longhurst, the new artistic director of the pint-sized Donmar, but before he takes over there he’s putting on &lt;strong&gt;The Son &lt;/strong&gt;by Florian Zeller at the Kiln. And yes, there will probably still be protesters outside, furious that it’s no longer called the Tricycle. No one else can understand that made them so angry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Talking of men, here’s a fun fact: 2019 marks the first time that ex-National Theatre artistic director Nicholas Hytner, now at the Bridge, will direct a play by a living person without a Y chromosome. In March, he’s overseeing &lt;strong&gt;Alys&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Always &lt;/strong&gt;by Lucinda Coxon, based on the novel about journalism and privilege by Harriet Lane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Bridge is undoubtedly a gorgeous venue, with great sight-lines, but it has struggled to find its feet since opening in 2017. Its plays have been dismissed as half-cooked (Alan Bennett’s &lt;em&gt;Allelujah!&lt;/em&gt;) or fully bonkers (Martin McDonagh’s &lt;em&gt;A Very Very Very Dark Matter&lt;/em&gt;) and it badly needs a hit. The fact that Laura Linney is returning for another go at the well-reviewed but pedestrian monologue &lt;strong&gt;My Name is Lucy Barton &lt;/strong&gt;tells its own story, as does the fact that the National Theatre is also relying on some old favourites to shift tickets: &lt;strong&gt;Follies &lt;/strong&gt;is repeating at the Olivier in 2019, as &lt;em&gt;War Horse&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Amadeus &lt;/em&gt;did before it. The vast auditorium is one of the most challenging stages in London, and musicals seem to be the most reliable way of filling it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The highlight of the rest of the National’s season is &lt;strong&gt;When We Have Sufficiently Tortured Each Other&lt;/strong&gt;, starring Cate Blanchett and directed by Katie Mitchell, but if you haven’t already triumphed in the ticket ballot, bad luck. For reasons beyond understanding, it’s playing in the National’s smallest theatre, the Dorfman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Some other highlights: Anne Washburn’s &lt;strong&gt;Shipwreck&lt;/strong&gt;, at the Almeida, promises to be as weird as her two previous plays there, &lt;em&gt;Mr Burns&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;The Twilight Zone&lt;/strong&gt; (the latter is heading to the West End this year). It’s about the US president, but expect aliens, time travel or opera &lt;em&gt;at minimum&lt;/em&gt;. Ivo van Hove continues his reign as the Amol Rajan of theatre (he’s everywhere). Take your pick between Gillian Anderson and Lily James in &lt;strong&gt;All About Eve&lt;/strong&gt; in the West End from February, or the more experimental &lt;strong&gt;The Damned&lt;/strong&gt; at the Barbican in June. (He ends the year with a newly choreographed version of &lt;strong&gt;West Side Story&lt;/strong&gt; on Broadway, to wind down.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Also at the Barbican is Cillian Murphy in Grief is the&lt;strong&gt; Thing with Feathers&lt;/strong&gt;. Shirtlessness is surely a given as Tom Hiddleston wraps up the Pinter season with &lt;strong&gt;Betrayal&lt;/strong&gt;. Malorie Blackman’s beloved YA novel, &lt;strong&gt;Noughts and Crosses&lt;/strong&gt;, travels to Derby, Salford and elsewhere in an adaptation by Sabrina Mahfouz. Jack Thorne is writing about politics in 1997 (sigh) with &lt;strong&gt;The End of History&lt;/strong&gt; at the Royal Court in July. Plus, not one but two productions of &lt;strong&gt;Three Sisters&lt;/strong&gt;: Patsy Ferran and director Rebecca Frecknall reunite in April after their five-star&lt;em&gt; Summer and Smoke, &lt;/em&gt;then poet Inua Ellams transports Chekhov to 1960s Nigeria at the National in the autumn. &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;
	Anyone who has ever stood alone in a desert at nightfall – or walked out in the eerie blue half-light of the winter tundra and heard the coyotes, or the wolves, calling back and forth in the dark – has experienced the fleeting, and inexplicable sense of what Jean-Paul Sartre once called the nothingness that haunts being. In a seminar room, or a library, this sounds like a bleak, if somewhat academic proposition – but &lt;em&gt;en plein air&lt;/em&gt;, it is strangely exhilarating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Outside, far enough from the town lights to really see the sky, that nothingness can claim us, not, as we might have expected, for some kind of oblivion, but for the call and response that all lives share – with other lives, certainly  but also with the void. This may sound fanciful, but it is a commonplace of every speculative tradition that we come from: we go back to nothing, whether we picture that nothing as the absolution of the all-healing earth, some pulverising wind, or just the thin light of the horizon, when the desert sun goes down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	All this will seem unlikely, no doubt; and there is no scientific reason to supply such metaphysical interpretations to the various calls that pack animals make in the dark (calls that, in reality, are part of an entirely practical vocabulary of hunting, territory and courtship). Still, to a human ear, there is something about this music that can render us exquisitely aware of the fact that life itself – for which so many unlikely variables had to lock precisely for it to happen at all – is something of a miracle. A miracle that is distilled to a hoarse bark in the dry scrub out on the prairie, or to a lingering and, hopefully, more distant howl over the snow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Yet this is only the half of it. The other part of life’s tall story is the even more surprising fact that I am here, conscious, aware of my mortality, listening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I must confess that this fanciful train of thought comes not from a recent moonlight ramble in the Sonoran desert, or the Canadian wilderness, but from the armchair pursuit of flicking through a field guide – in this case, José R Castelló’s marvellous &lt;em&gt;Canids of the World&lt;/em&gt;, recently published as part of Princeton Field Guides series. I have always loved books of this kind, and Castelló’s is a bible of “wolves, wild dogs, foxes, jackals, coyotes and their relatives”, as the subtitle proclaims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	However, I have never seen such guides merely as reference books. In fact, when they combine factual detail with a certain lyrical quality, which the best always do, a field guide can be the beginning of a long reverie, a reminder that, even in this comfortable armchair by the stove, I am also a natural creature, bonded in a loose web of interanimation with everything else that depends upon this earth for its improbable existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	We are here by the grace of one planet’s precise axial tilt and the bizarre chemistry of water. It comes as no surprise, then, that I feel a tug of belonging, of ancient kinship even, when I read Castelló’s entry for New Guinea Singing Dogs, who have “several unique vocalisations: the howl is similar to a wolf howl with overtones of whale song. When in a group, one animal starts and then others join on different pitches, each with its own unique voice. Some vocalisations resemble birdcalls. They also whine, yelp, bark and scream.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I can almost hear them and, one day, I may even get out of this armchair and go and listen to them in the flesh. For the moment, however, it is enough just to know that they exist. &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--

	It was a crime scene so bloody that the New Jersey police slid across the red-pooled floor of the bar. That was one of the many insistent details in a new podcast about a triple homicide in 1966 for which the middleweight boxer Rubin Carter was tried, convicted, and released twice – eventually freed after near-20 years behind bars. “The full story has never been told – until now!” goes the long drum roll in episode one (in that helplessly preening way of Real Life Investigation podcasts), after which we are promised excerpts from “40 hours of unheard” tape recordings involving the police detective, Vincent DeSimone, who headed up the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	So catastrophic were Vincent’s injuries in the Second World War that his face was a chaos of scars and wounds, which caused him to slobber whenever he spoke – another burning detail. As is the story that Rubin Carter ran 100km in just 48 hours (that’s more than two marathons) to escape from a boys’ reformatory established during the civil war, full of “15-year-old rapists and killers”, where he’d suffered since he was eight years old. (I’ve found myself thinking miserably on that several times.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Might these tapes secure at last the truth about the murders? My guess is not; but I’ll be tuning in. The case famously inspired Bob Dylan’s 1975 song “Hurricane”, protesting Carter’s innocence. It was the singer’s one other “We Are the World” moment, so temperamentally allergic to joining in with causes had he been until that point. Carter was for a time the quintessential cause célèbre. (“The trial was a pig-circus/he never had a chance.”) But it’s not just the murders and mistrials, the racism and legacy of abuse, that truly powers this story. There is something to boxing itself that people cannot resist. Dylan, Hemingway, Mailer, Joyce Carol Oates… boxing just IS interesting. Even hearing Deontay Wilder and Tyson Fury giving into all that outside-the-ring trash talk in December, like a proper pair of bums, and then watching the fight itself – basically two people rolling around on the floor – there was still a… tiny nugget of purity. Like with chess: a heart and soul feels profoundly, somehow, on the line. I predict a smash. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;The Hurricane Tapes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	BBC Sounds&lt;/p&gt;

	This column doesn’t usually preview television; I write about stuff once it has aired, so that everyone might join in the conversation (ugh, I sound like I’m on some gruesome phone-in). But for Channel 4’s controversial drama &lt;em&gt;Brexit: The Uncivil War &lt;/em&gt;(7 January, 9pm) I make an exception. Why wait any longer? Even before Christmas, people had their knickers in a twist about this one – people, I should add, who’d only seen a trailer – on the grounds that the official Leave campaign, around which James Graham’s screenplay revolves, is under police investigation. Personally, I think we need to be careful when it comes to telling writers what they can, and can’t, use as material (unless an individual has been charged with a crime, at which point the case is&lt;em&gt; sub judice&lt;/em&gt;). But my duty here is only to tell you whether &lt;em&gt;Brexit: The Uncivil War&lt;/em&gt; is any good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Well, as it turns out, it is good. This isn’t to say that it has no flaws. Clearly, it does. Matters that are complex (the gathering of electoral data) are often made to seem overly straightforward; matters that are horribly simple are occasionally imbued with an import – and thus a sense of sympathy – they simply don’t deserve (in a focus group, a white, vaguely racist leaver weeps pitiably, insistent that in modern Britain she’s made to feel like “nothing”). A certain cartoonish-ness abounds, which can be pretty sickening: Nigel Farage and Arron Banks, for instance, are depicted as comic rather than sinister. But in context these are small things. Its strength lies in the way it exposes the Remain campaign’s smug complacency – an enamelled disregard for the disenfranchised that Graham gives a human shape in the form of Craig Oliver (Rory Kinnear), David Cameron’s former director of communications – and in its determination, if not to make a hero of Dominic Cummings, the chief strategist of Vote Leave, then at least to render him a fully formed character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	By Graham’s telling, Cummings is at once both utterly monstrous and peculiarly vulnerable; highly intelligent and incredibly stupid; deeply amoral and yet oddly virtuous. In other words, he’s a human being, if not exactly a terribly regular one. All this, however, is not only in the writing. At times, in fact, it’s not in the writing at all. &lt;em&gt;Brexit: The Uncivil War&lt;/em&gt; is utterly and completely Benedict Cumberbatch’s show – and when it goes out, perhaps all the dumbos out there will finally understand why he, a firm Remainer, took the part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	What an irresistible performance he turns in: weird, committed, minutely observed. He even manages a decent County Durham accent: close your eyes, and he could be Gina McKee (or my late Auntie Vera before her first sherry of the day). Did Cummings, as Graham suggests, hear noises in his head, a low-level hum that was the ghostly sound of the Britain that politicians long ago stopped listening to? I don’t know. But when you see Cumberbatch tuning into it, you feel no scepticism or disbelief. It’s a bit like &lt;em&gt;Hamlet&lt;/em&gt;. You wonder about his character, and in that wondering is part of your enjoyment and satisfaction at what is on stage. This could be madness (Cummings is considered a psychopath by his enemies), or it could be something else entirely: an aural vision; a performative trance; the beginnings of a neurasthenia brought on by workaholism (to his admirers, he’s a genius).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Repulsive as he often is, Cummings certainly has his qualities. When he tells the twittish Bernard Jenkin MP (busy trying to oust him from his job at Vote Leave on the grounds that he’s uncivilised) to get stuffed, you want nothing more than to cheer him on. Ditto when he informs Daniel Hannan, the Eurosceptic MEP, that his (Cummings’s) team are “intelligent, unlike you, Dan”; or when he mutters that Farage is a “stupid c***”. Given the state of our current political culture, this stuff practically counts as nuance. Channel 4’s youngish, urban audience will likely regard Cummings as the antichrist, and yet here he is: right about at least three things. Between them, Graham and Cumberbatch have delivered what amounts to an act of radical empathy. You may not like it at all, but this doesn’t mean that it won’t also do you some good. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Brexit: The Uncivil War&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Channel 4&lt;/p&gt;

	Politics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
	European politics will become transnational…&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Yanis Varoufakis, economist and MEP candidate for Germany&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Since our generation’s 1929 erupted upon us in 2008, Europe has been in the grip of a vicious dynamic. A banking crisis, disguised as a public debt crisis, shifted the losses made by banks onto the shoulders of the weakest across Europe. The establishment’s deflationary policies, imposed via increasing authoritarianism, begat political monsters everywhere – from Germany and Holland to Greece and now Spain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This will be a pivotal year, and my party will offer something new to progressive Europeanists in the European Parliament elections: a transnational “European Spring”, a Green New Deal for Europe, and an antidote to the emergent axis of authoritarianism, the monsters of the xenophobic right, and the authoritarian establishment. 2019 will be another country, and another continent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	 &lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
	…but the European Parliament will become more Eurosceptic&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Helen Lewis, journalist&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Whether Britain is still technically a member or not, the European Union will go ahead with its parliamentary elections in May 2019. There are reasons to be worried about the results: many right-wing populist parties across the continent are opposed to the EU, regularly depicting it as the tool of a bloated, out-of-touch international elite. If their ranks swell in May – as you&#039;d expect, given the success of parties like Hungary&#039;s Fidesz and France&#039;s Front National in domestic elections – then the European Parliament will become increasingly blocked and intractable. And if the executive responds by acting unilaterally, or heads of state begin to bypass the EU&#039;s formal structures, that will lead to more accusations of a “democratic deficit” at the heart of the European project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
	Brexit-obsessed politicians will be easier to interview&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Emma Barnett, journalist&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I predict politicians in 2019 will continue to have their eyes too firmly fixed on Brexit at the expense of all else. Most ministers, governmental and shadow, are already distracted from their briefs and it takes very little probing to reveal those ensuing knowledge gaps to the British public. Theresa May says she doesn’t want the Conservative party to become a one-policy party, but all parties are falling prey to Brexit domination – at what cost?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;The Emma Barnett Show is on BBC Radio 5 Live, Mon-Thu 10am-1pm.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
	We’ll find out if austerity is really “over”&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Meg Hillier, chair of the Public Accounts Committee&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With 12 weeks before our exit the government will already be ramping up preparation and spending for a no-deal Brexit. Practically the government will need to either extend Article 50 or rescind it as time is running out. The Public Accounts Committee will be adding up the cost of preparing for all three Brexit options – deal, no deal and deal with a transition period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The economic impact of the uncertainty over Brexit will put pressure on the forthcoming spending review which will also be looking at capital assets and incorporating recommendations from the modernising defence programme. So big ticket challenges, with little spare cash in the exchequer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	My guess is that the spending review will be delayed and refocused to reflect the impacts of Brexit. This will make it challenging for local government which continues to face cuts to funding and is limping along with one off funding injections. As we can see from winter pressures in the NHS late, one-off funds do little to protect frontline services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;rtecenter&quot;&gt;
	Economics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
	Productivity will be crucial to the economy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Andy Haldane, chair of the Industrial Strategy Council and chief economist at the Bank of England&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Since the global financial crisis, the UK economy has consistently operated below full capacity.  A decade on, it is good news that the economy is now bumping up against its capacity constraints.  This is the main reason inflation-adjusted pay in the UK economy is now rising, having stood still for a decade.  To keep pay rising consistently, though, we will need the UK’s supply-side capacity, or productivity, to keep expanding. Where productivity leads, pay follows. That is why productivity growth – or the lack of it – has risen to such prominence recently. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Tackling the UK’s productivity (and pay) problem calls for a multi-pronged policy response. It calls for improvements in education, skills, investment, infrastructure and innovation. These are the raw ingredients of the government’s Industrial Strategy. Now is the time to deliver on that strategy, with the government’s new Industrial Strategy Council (which I chair) providing independent scrutiny and support. Delivering on that strategy is the best contribution economic policy can make to rising productivity among companies and rising pay among workers, in all parts of the UK.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
	The EU will need to handle Italy carefully&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Jim O’Neill, chair of Chatham House &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Since I first started looking at Italy in 1982, I’ve heard concerns about Italian state debt. Through the millennium, occasional bouts of strong nominal GDP growth kept a lid on Italy’s debt growth, but following the introduction of the Euro its debt has become higher and more risky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Italy needs structural reforms and stronger productivity, but the current government’s budget proposals are unlikely to help. The Italian government has agreed some changes to these proposals to comply with EU demands, but fundamental shifts of substance are unlikely, not least because the plans are part of the appeal that voters backed in electing a  peculiar alliance of populists from both the left and right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	However, the EU needs to be careful not to forcibly ignore democratic choices in its member countries, especially one like Italy. A true Greek-style crisis with Italian debt would have the chance of blowing up the whole of the Eurozone and have significant consequences for Germany. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
	Pension contributions will quietly rise&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Ros Altmann, crossbench peer and former pensions minister&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	April sees the final stage of pensions auto-enrolment begin, so workers and their employers will increase the amount they put into their pensions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Hopefully, more employers will also help their staff to better understand the value of pensions. With Brexit dominating, it is unlikely that we will see major new pension initiatives, but the planned Pensions Dashboard would bring simpler statements and greater transparency to help people keep track of their pensions and understand how important they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;rtecenter&quot;&gt;
	Science, tech and health&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
	Technology will create opportunities and threats&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Martin Rees, astronomer royal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As a scientist I&#039;m excited about potential discoveries, here on Earth and in the depths of space. But as an anxious member of the human race it&#039;s hard to be optimistic about the current scene. I think we will, collectively, have a bumpy ride in the coming years – not just fallout from the Brexit shambles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Our interconnected world is becoming more vulnerable to disruption by individuals and small groups, empowered by ever more powerful biotech, cybertech and AI. The global village will have its village idiots and they&#039;ll have global range. I worry that whatever regulations nations formulate for restraining these technologies, they can&#039;t be enforced globally any more than the drug laws and the tax laws can. Whatever can be done will be done by someone, somewhere. Pressure to minimize this threat will engender growing tension between privacy, freedom, and security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
	The NHS will need to make decisions on data&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Ara Darzi, director of the Institute of Global Health Innovation at Imperial College London&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The ban on the purchase of new fax machines for the NHS, announced by the Department of Health last month, is a long overdue signal of intent: to push the NHS into the digital age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	 In my &lt;em&gt;Review of Health and Care&lt;/em&gt;, published to mark the NHS’s 70th anniversary last July, I argued for a “tilt to tech.” We are on the cusp of a new revolution in robotics, artificial intelligence and digital applications powered by the NHS’s unrivalled sources of data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With the use of digital techniques, we may speed progress to the next breakthroughs in medical science and transform care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But we need to demonstrate why data sharing is a social benefit, as necessary to the public good as taxes. The challenge is to devise a system of data governance that protects the interests of patients, provides access for researchers, distributes the fruits of success fairly and wins the confidence of the public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
	London will take a stand on air pollution&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Sadiq Khan, Mayor of London&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I’m sure Brexit will dominate 2019, but it will also be the year when we take the boldest steps yet to combat London’s killer air, which causes the premature deaths of thousands of Londoners every year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I know from personal experience that the city&#039;s air is damaging people&#039;s health; I started suffering from asthma as an adult. It is particularly damning that our toxic air health crisis is harming the lung growth and the health of young Londoners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	 As Mayor, I simply refuse to stand back while Londoners breathe air that shortens our life expectancy, harms our lungs and worsens chronic illnesses. So, on April 8, we will be are launching the world’s first 24-hour “ultra-low emission zone” to help take the most polluted vehicles off central London’s streets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;rtecenter&quot;&gt;
	Media and culture&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
	News will become more about membership&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Jasper Jackson, journalist&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	On 13 December, Dutch news start-up De Correspondent announced it had successfully crowd-funded $2.5m for an English language launch. Built around consultation and conversation with paying members, who suggest stories and even provide leads, the &lt;em&gt;Correspondent&lt;/em&gt; points to a more hopeful direction for publishers still struggling to adjust to the internet. Others, such &lt;em&gt;Tortoise&lt;/em&gt;, the slow news startup from former BBC News boss James Harding, and even the &lt;em&gt;Guardian&lt;/em&gt;, are also focussed on tapping enthusiastic supporters as a foundation for longevity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While the “mass” part of mass media (and its attendant advertising income) has largely been ceded to Facebook and Google, journalistic outlets old and new will increasingly use digital tools to focus on relationships rather than eyeballs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
	Live comedy will lead the way&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Deborah Frances-White, creator of &lt;em&gt;The Guilty Feminist&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The reason that women are creating some of the most exciting spaces in comedy and podcasting is that the traditional routes are often closed down to us. If any of my television pilots had been greenlit, I’d never have thought of &lt;em&gt;The Guilty Feminist&lt;/em&gt;. It’s a space that has been shaped by me, my throbbingly talented co-hosts and the demands of our dynamic audience. We’re under no obligation to please exec producers, fit into a time slot or feature right-wing pundits “for balance”, so we’ve been free to create something that really fizzes in the Petri dish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In 2019, expect to see even more female-created ,female-heavy mixed-gender spaces in comedy and podcasting. Cariad Lloyd, Reni Eddo-Lodge and Elizabeth Day are innovating in studio podcasts, and watch out for &lt;em&gt;GrownUpLand&lt;/em&gt;, Jessica Fostekew’s &lt;em&gt;X, Y, Z, Boom&lt;/em&gt; and live sensation &lt;em&gt;Amusical&lt;/em&gt; from extraordinary comedy duo Jayde Adams and Kiri Pritchard-McLean. The age of one woman to five men is over. Live is leading, and television is following.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;The Guilty Feminist: Live tours the UK from May to June 2019. For dates see &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.guiltyfeminist.com/&quot;&gt;guiltyfeminist.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
	It’ll be a good year for proper bookshops&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;James Daunt, managing director of Waterstones&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For 30 years, I&#039;ve been reading the same predictions; I&#039;m absolutely confident that the death of literary fiction will be predicted, and we will sell more literary fiction than ever before. And that growth will come in a very traditional way, with proper books being sold largely through proper bookshops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The extraordinary thing about our little world is that everybody is always thinking it&#039;s going to change – confusing it for music, or journalism, where things are tougher – but if we do our jobs properly we carry on perfectly nicely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I could not feel more gloomy about Brexit, in part because bookshops represent a certain set of values that feel challenged at the moment. But book sales can remain almost unaffected by recession, and it seems even to have favoured booksellers in the past – the growth of Ottakar&#039;s and Waterstones happened in the teeth of the early Nineties recession. Books are an extremely affordable pleasure – our customers keep on reading, and perhaps even take refuge in books.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--

    <title>Violent experiment or the original Love Island? The 1970s “sex raft” where women were in power</title>

	In May 1973, just after the collapse of the Paris Peace Accords, a Mexican anthropologist, Santiago Genovés, set out to create the perfect laboratory to study the human instinct for violence. This laboratory was a raft, 40 foot long and 24 foot wide. It would float the 5,000 miles from Las Palmas in the Canary Islands to the Mexican port of Cozumel, with a small but attractive cargo of humans.&lt;em&gt; “&lt;/em&gt;Would an isolated group of people on a raft co-operate to survive, or would they fight each other?” he asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	He posted a &quot;general vacancy&quot; in the international newspapers, asking for young people, preferably married: the ad made clear they would be participating without their spouses, so hundreds wanted to go. Genovés selected six women from across the world to join him, and four men, including an Angolan priest, whom he hoped would add an element of guilt and shame to the sexual tension on board. They would sleep side by side, male next to female. But, while Genovés was sponsored by Mexican TV and tabloids the world over picked up on the story of his “sex raft”, he had higher designs than &lt;em&gt;Love Island&lt;/em&gt;. He’d chosen women for all the principal roles – Edna, from Israel, was the ship’s doctor; Frenchwoman Servane was diver and maintenance girl; and Swedish Maria, the first woman in the world with a professional sea-captain’s degree, was the boat’s bikini’d boss. “Would having women in power lead to less violence, or would there be more?” he wondered. The UN wished them luck on their mission for world peace, and Genovés chose a bunk between the two hottest girls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The story of the &lt;em&gt;Acali&lt;/em&gt; (the vessel’s name) is told in a new film, &lt;em&gt;The Raft&lt;/em&gt;, by Marcus Lindeen. There is footage of Genovés rotating a skull in his fingers, his first-person logbook voiced by an actor like a warped professor from &lt;em&gt;Cannibal Holocaust. &lt;/em&gt;Forty-five years on, reflecting a general trend in humanity, only the women, and a Japanese man, are alive to discuss their experience (Genovés died in 2013). Warmly, they recall their relationships, while sitting in a mock-up boat. One signed up to escape an abusive husband. Another communed with her slave ancestors, feeling their voices vibrating through the waves. Of course, they didn’t speak of these things back when they were young and cool. “You should have &lt;em&gt;told &lt;/em&gt;me,” they all say. “We knew so little about each other...”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To Genovés’s distress, there was no violence on his sex raft. There was sex, but it wasn’t very convenient: “If you were both on the watch at night, you &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt;, but you had to be quick, and you had to use one hand for steering.” Genovés’s log spins drama from his drifting odyssey. The crew catch a shark, and he watches José Maria from Uruguay pass round its beating heart. “Crowd frenzy!” he records. “They are acting as part of a dangerous collective!” They weren’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Fifty days on and bored, Genovés spilled the contents of the 46 questionnaires he’d made his crew answer – the 1970s equivalent of playing the tapes from the &lt;em&gt;Big Brother &lt;/em&gt;diary room. His stirring had little effect. A tropical storm approached – “a dangerous hurricane might be &lt;em&gt;exactly &lt;/em&gt;what we need for the experiment to evolve!” – but it turned at the last minute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	He gave up, and languished in bed, while his crew, who’d weathered little more than the usual frustrations of group-living, partied in defiance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I participated in many voluntary projects in my youth, hatching turtles in Mexico and digging ditches in Thailand. The small international crowds were festivals of accord, the broken English a language of pure sweetness. The only person who ever pissed anyone off was the leader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	From his bed, Genovés imagined a new raft, “big enough for just one person, lying down. And the bottom should be made of glass. So that I can drift across the ocean one more time, looking through into the depths of the water. Just by myself.” When he came into port, he pulled himself together and flipped his hypothesis. The experiment had been a success, he claimed. He’d found “a new kind of man – free from all fateful territorial ambitions, and all aggressive or sadistic impulses”. &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--

    <title>2019 – the big questions: Could Facebook be broken up?</title>
    <link>https://www.newstatesman.com/science-tech/social-media/2019/01/2019-big-questions-could-facebook-be-broken</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-subheadline field-type-text-long field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;
	 Facebook’s essential facility is unclear – is it a social network; a publisher of video, text, pictures and games; a communications service; or an advertising agency?&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-node-image field-type-image field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;noscript class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoints=&quot;300 768 1024&quot; data-adaptive-image-300-img=&quot;&amp;lt;img class=&amp;quot;adaptive-image&amp;quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&amp;quot;300&amp;quot; typeof=&amp;quot;foaf:Image&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/lead_image/public/Longreads_2019/01/2019_01_zuckerberg_will_dunn.jpg?itok=RFm6d1kG&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&quot; data-adaptive-image-768-img=&quot;&amp;lt;img class=&amp;quot;adaptive-image&amp;quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&amp;quot;768&amp;quot; typeof=&amp;quot;foaf:Image&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/lead_image/public/Longreads_2019/01/2019_01_zuckerberg_will_dunn.jpg?itok=RFm6d1kG&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&quot; data-adaptive-image-1024-img=&quot;&amp;lt;img class=&amp;quot;adaptive-image&amp;quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&amp;quot;1024&amp;quot; typeof=&amp;quot;foaf:Image&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/lead_image/public/Longreads_2019/01/2019_01_zuckerberg_will_dunn.jpg?itok=RFm6d1kG&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&quot; data-adaptive-image-max-img=&quot;&amp;lt;img class=&amp;quot;adaptive-image&amp;quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&amp;quot;max&amp;quot; typeof=&amp;quot;foaf:Image&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/lead_image/public/Longreads_2019/01/2019_01_zuckerberg_will_dunn.jpg?itok=RFm6d1kG&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&quot;&gt;&lt;img typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/Longreads_2019/01/2019_01_zuckerberg_will_dunn.jpg?itok=HQKFcrfT&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;
	In July last year, a week after she fined Google €4.34bn (£3.9bn) for  breaching antitrust rules, the EU competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager, appeared on &lt;em&gt;Anger Management&lt;/em&gt;, a podcast run by the former deputy prime minister Nick Clegg. It was not the first time they had spoken – the European Commission’s list of meetings shows they met officially in January 2017 – but Clegg’s public chat with the regulator most feared by Big Tech may have landed him a job. Less than three months later, Facebook announced that Clegg had been appointed as its new head of global affairs and communications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The following month, amid many fewer column inches, Facebook made two more significant hires: Johan Keetelaar, director of telecommunications at the Authority for Consumers and Markets in the Netherlands, and Kate Patchen, who led the US department of justice’s antitrust section in San Francisco – in other words, two of the most senior competition regulators in Europe and the US. Facebook has hired top lawmakers in the past, including Timothy Muris, former chairman of the US Federal Trade Commission, and Kevin Martin, former chair of the Federal Communications Commission. But this activity has increased as the tech giant is accused of obliterating the press, spreading hatred and misinformation, and operating a monopoly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It is this last point that is most important to lawmakers. Claims that Facebook has swayed elections or even played a role in genocide are appalling, but difficult to prove. A monopoly is quantifiable. Facebook has a market share of 77 per cent of social media use in Europe, not including Instagram, which it owns. The original uses of the mobile phone, speech and messaging, have largely been captured by WhatsApp, which serves 65 billion messages and 3,800 years’ worth of calls a day, and is owned, again, by Facebook. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When Mark Zuckerberg appeared before Congress in April 2018, the Republican senator Lindsey Graham asked him to name his main competitor, or a product that consumers could choose instead. As Zuckerberg stalled, Graham asked if Facebook was a monopoly. The best Zuckerberg could offer was that it “doesn’t feel like that to me”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The documents seized in late November by Damian Collins, chair of the culture, media and sport select committee, detail a pattern of activity at Facebook that certainly feels anti-competitive. Competitors that used Facebook’s Onavo app – sold as a security measure – were monitored. Commercial partners were “whitelisted” for special access to user data. On 24 January 2013, Twitter – Facebook ‘s biggest competitor for social media market share – launched an app called Vine, which enabled users to post short, shareable videos. The same day, Facebook’s vice president Justin Osofsky emailed Mark Zuckerberg to warn him that Vine users could “find friends via FB [Facebook]” and to suggest they “shut down their friends API access today” – throttling the data that Vine could receive from its own users. Zuckerberg replied: “Yup, go for it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Facebook is also a new kind of company – global, nebulous and constantly changing. The economist Jean Tirole points out that natural monopolies occur when a technology’s “essential facility” cannot realistically be duplicated. Railway lines, an energy grid or a telephone network all do one job for which it is very hard to create a competing alternative. Last century, it was possible to break up Standard Oil and AT&amp;amp;T into smaller entities without affecting the services they provided. Yet Facebook’s essential facility is less clear – is it a social network; a publisher of video, text, pictures and games; a communications service; or an advertising agency? Nor can it be separated into equally valuable components; Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, WhatsApp, Oculus and others are interdependent, and the data they share is crucial to Facebook’s dominance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There is also the question of who gets to regulate Facebook, and how. The EU can issue heavy fines, but a company that serves 2.2 billion people around the world is a slippery thing to regulate. This is why Facebook, despite having made £1.3bn from advertising sales in the UK last year, paid just £7.4m net tax (0.62 per cent).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The political will to tame Facebook may also waver. Donald Trump has said that his administration is “certainly looking” at antitrust allegations, but his new North American Free Trade Agreement gives Facebook more power to challenge US regulators. It must also be asked why he would regulate a company credited with assisting his rise to power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Yet this does not mean that 2019 will be a great year for Facebook, because there are still two agents who can do more than any regulator to curtail Facebook’s power. These are the agents who gave it that power in the first place: the user and the investor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	On 25 July last year, Facebook’s total stock market capitalisation was over $620bn (£490bn). This is as much as $500bn (£395bn) more than all the revenue it has earned since it became cash-flow positive in 2009. On 26 July, Facebook published quarterly results that showed slower-than-expected growth of both revenue and users. The company’s stock fell 20 per cent, wiping $120bn (£90.8bn) off its market cap; it has since fallen to its lowest level for more than 18 months. In less than an hour, Zuckerberg lost an amount of money comparable to the yearly GDP of Cambodia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In September, Pew Research published a survey of 3,400 Facebook users which found that 44 per cent of the 18-29 age group had deleted the Facebook app from their phone in the past year. This, more than anything else, should be Facebook’s wake-up call; nearly every trend in internet use has been led by the young. These users are the product Facebook sells to its clients, and they appear to be leaving in droves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This could be because of Facebook’s many scandals. But  monopolies are also dull. And on the internet, sold to the young as a cure for boredom, no regulator is as powerful as the simple decision to switch off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

    <title>If AI is going to have any future in health care, it’s going to have to get a lot smarter</title>

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;
	For the past 40 years, the UK has been a world leader in developing patient-centred models of medical care. The paternalistic doctor of the postwar era has gradually given way to an expert collaborator – someone who expects patients to have their own ideas, concerns and expectations (ICE) about their health, and seeks to incorporate these, along with the realities of medical practice, into a shared understanding of the problem and what to do about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Some patients are upfront about their ICE, but many are reticent about articulating them. They may worry that the doctor will think them stupid, or they’ll cause offence by seeming to tell a professional how to do their job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There are various ways of drawing these issues out. Prior to consulting a doctor, most people will already have sought multiple opinions from elsewhere – Google, of course; also family and friends, colleagues, newspapers and magazines. Questions such as: “What have you been reading about this kind of problem?”, or “What does your husband/mum say about it all?” can open up fruitful conversations. By letting people know we expect them to have their own model of what’s going on with their health, we give them permission to disclose it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Some patients aren’t even consciously aware of their ICE. Asking: “Do you know anyone who’s had anything similar?” can bring out the story of the dimly remembered aunt whose brain tumour presented with headaches, or the workmate who was dead six weeks after his backache turned out to be lung cancer. The lid lifted, the connections between their symptoms and subconscious fears can begin to be made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	ICE matter. If a patient can explain their own model, it dramatically increases their confidence in the care they’re receiving. And from a doctor’s point of view, understanding a patient’s ICE is vital to making correct diagnoses, as well as to tailoring management to the individual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Against this background, the current vogue for “artificial intelligence” in health seems distinctly retrograde. Apps such as Babylon Health’s GP at Hand recreate a bygone era where a somewhat remote-seeming doctor would subject the patient to a barrage of narrow questions about their symptoms, at the end of which they would pronounce their opinion as to what the trouble was and what to do about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If AI is to have any future in health care, it’s going to have to get a lot smarter. Algorithms will have to be programmed to draw out patients’ ICE, correctly interpret how they affect the picture being presented, and incorporate them into a mutually acceptable way to proceed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	And that only covers the words spoken. Most of what we communicate as human beings comes across non-verbally. Our body language – how we sit, what our hands are doing as we talk, where our gaze rests – all underscore what we’re saying. Forget face recognition technology: AI is going to have to be able to analyse facial expression; to detect the rimming of tear fluid in an eye, for example, that speaks of a painful memory having been stirred. And often, the most important communication comes through what is not said – the question not answered, the jump to an apparently unconnected topic. Lots for the coders to get to grips with there too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Then there are the subtle physical signs. It’s easy enough to plug someone’s pulse and temperature into an algorithm, but what about powering the AI of the future to detect the shuffling gait of Parkinson’s, the pallor of anaemia, the grunting respiration of the baby with pneumonia?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Will 2019 see artificial intelligence beginning to replace doctors? No doubt, spurred by the Labrador-like enthusiasm of Matt Hancock, the Secretary of State for Health, the app developers will be putting in a determined effort. But sometime between now and 2090, I suspect it will gradually dawn on people quite how hard it would be to replicate what a doctor does. Then the NHS might start investing properly in its human resources again. &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--

    <title>At my bedside, the nurse asked: would I recommend Charing Cross Hospital to my friends?</title>

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;
	I know many people who have done DNA tests, and I would like to think that my results would be more interesting than most, but there is no getting around the fact that while I may not be all that English, I was raised among them, and certain traits have rubbed off on me. One of them is a certain reluctance to make a fuss, which is why it took me so long to call the ambulance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It had been a hectic few days. First there was the trip down to London, which involves seven hours of cabs and trains and a great deal of money. I had to get there in time for the tenth anniversary bash for this magazine’s editor. If I missed it, when was I going to next get the opportunity to make a fool of myself in front of him? As it is, I managed it nicely, and also made a fool of myself in front of Ed Smith, late of this parish and now chief England cricket selector (at which he is doing a damn fine job).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	That was the easy part. Trips to London involve a lot of negotiation and pleading about where I am going to be staying, if one is to avoid staying for too many consecutive nights with my mother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As it turned out, I did stay a couple of nights, and it was just as well, for she tripped over the cleaning lady’s Hoover flex and I was able to help staunch the flow of blood from the cut she sustained over her eye. It is going to be one of those Christmases, I feared, as she bewailed her fate, the cleaning lady’s stupidity, her own inattentiveness, and the fear that her looks were going to be marred forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I was due the next day to go to a party with the Estranged Wife and then to stay the night at my daughter’s boyfriend’s new flat in Islington (he is that rare thing, a man in his mid-twenties who can afford his own accommodation). But I started feeling iller and iller, and by the time we were meant to leave I was confined first to the sofa, and then to the mattress on the living room floor which my daughter had been using.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I had no idea what I was ill with – I felt like I’d been poisoned – but as the night progressed I found my lungs closing up, which is the kind of condition that prioritises itself over other considerations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	By about three in the morning it was becoming almost impossible to breathe and I began to wonder whether I ought to call 111, in order to ask them if I should call 999. After a while I did, and after a long question-and-answer routine during which they determined I was not having a heart attack, which I could have told them myself, they ordered an ambulance for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The last time I’d been in an ambulance was with my father, on the way back from one of his dialysis sessions at the Royal Free. Can that be right? It’s how I remember it, and I also remember his gentle courtesy to the paramedics. The time before that had been probably ten to 15 years before – this time I was the passenger, undergoing the last severe asthma attack I’d suffered. On that occasion they actually carried me down the stairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This time I had to wait an hour and eventually walk down the street towards it, carrying in my pocket the Christmas edition of the &lt;em&gt;TLS&lt;/em&gt; and a copy of Graham Greene’s &lt;em&gt;The Heart of the Matter&lt;/em&gt;, a novel which, like &lt;em&gt;Brideshead Revisited&lt;/em&gt;, works best if you consider it as a piece of black anti-Catholic propaganda. But at the time I was thinking more of Larkin. “The fastened doors recede. Poor soul,/They whisper at their own distress,” etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	And so I was nebulised and, once at the hospital, intubated and X-rayed and generally looked after; the cannula I could do little about, but the blood sample, from a vein deep in my left wrist, seemed to have something optional about it. It was recommended, but it would hurt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While I was screwing up my courage, a nurse with a clipboard asked me if I would recommend Charing Cross Hospital to friends and relatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	At first I couldn’t believe my ears, but then said “of course”; for my care had been exemplary, although I did not realise one had an option once the ambulance doors had closed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A few days later a letter arrived, containing the diagnosis of my X-ray. Well, they are almost certain it’s not cancer. It is probably, though, something as intractable, and, ultimately, bad for one. I looked it up on the internet. Perhaps I shouldn’t have done that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Still, God bless the NHS, and thanks to them, my saga continues. But which one? I started reading one of the Norse sagas, and this line struck me: “Ufeig was a wise man, and full of good counsel; he was great-hearted in all wise, but unhandy at money-getting.” &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--

    <title>Why 2019 could be the year of joyful singledom</title>

	A new female empowerment movement is encouraging more women than ever to avoid unfulfilling relationships in exchange for a better, independent life. &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-node-image field-type-image field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;noscript class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoints=&quot;300 768 1024&quot; data-adaptive-image-300-img=&quot;&amp;lt;img class=&amp;quot;adaptive-image&amp;quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&amp;quot;300&amp;quot; typeof=&amp;quot;foaf:Image&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2019/01/gettyimages-882239730.jpg?itok=ZJJnrG9a&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&quot; data-adaptive-image-768-img=&quot;&amp;lt;img class=&amp;quot;adaptive-image&amp;quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&amp;quot;768&amp;quot; typeof=&amp;quot;foaf:Image&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2019/01/gettyimages-882239730.jpg?itok=ZJJnrG9a&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&quot; data-adaptive-image-1024-img=&quot;&amp;lt;img class=&amp;quot;adaptive-image&amp;quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&amp;quot;1024&amp;quot; typeof=&amp;quot;foaf:Image&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2019/01/gettyimages-882239730.jpg?itok=ZJJnrG9a&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&quot; data-adaptive-image-max-img=&quot;&amp;lt;img class=&amp;quot;adaptive-image&amp;quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&amp;quot;max&amp;quot; typeof=&amp;quot;foaf:Image&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2019/01/gettyimages-882239730.jpg?itok=ZJJnrG9a&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&quot;&gt;&lt;img typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2019/01/gettyimages-882239730.jpg?itok=ZJJnrG9a&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;
	Cuffing season is a long-standing, internet-invented institution. The period when we move from early autumn into colder months is renowned for causing panicked singles to couple up (“cuff” themselves to each other) to avoid spending the miserable winter months alone. For years, writers have wryly observed that cuffing leads to long-term relationships based on superficial choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	However, 2019 may herald the end of needless cuffing. In its place, we can expect a new global movement: mass dumping. In 2019, more people than ever will opt out of relationships and choose to be single, heeding the perennial advice – “dump him!” – littered in the comment sections of Tumblr, Twitter and Instagram. And more often than not, the people avoiding relationships will be women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The promotion of the single life isn’t entirely new. But the fourth wave of feminism and the #MeToo movement are encouraging more women to end unfulfilling relationships (which would once have lasted for years or decades) in exchange for a better, independent life. In 2018, a hype machine for the single life created the conditions for a new year of overdue break-ups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Two hugely popular books lauding singledom were published in the second half of 2018: &lt;em&gt;How To Be Alone&lt;/em&gt;, by former &lt;em&gt;Cosmopolitan&lt;/em&gt; sex and relationships editor Lane Moore, and the remarkable &lt;em&gt;What A Time To Be Alone&lt;/em&gt;, by 23-year-old women’s rights activist Chidera Eggerue; both books encourage people – and women in particular – to find pleasure in solitude, warning against entering relationships before learning how to be content by yourself. These books are aimed at straight women, a group who have long been told that their value depends on their partner and who have been burdened by societal pressure to shackle themselves to a man – irrespective of his behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Eggerue, who is predominantly known by her pen name “The Slumflower”, became a leader in the romantic independence movement in 2018 (a graph charting internet searches for her name is near-vertical). In an interview with &lt;em&gt;gal-dem &lt;/em&gt;magazine, she described the ethos of singledom that won her acclaim. “We are sold romance and relationships as though they are the ultimate goal,” she said. “But your own company with yourself is just as valuable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Expanding on this in a TED Talk delivered in July 2018, Eggerue explained: “Often we use our relationships with other people as a distraction from ourselves. We use other people as a tool to run away from the responsibility of getting to know who we really are.” Through these messages, Eggerue has given thousands of women the courage finally to break free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The singledom trend has also been spread by the female sexual empowerment movement emerging online. Sex and relationships writer Dami “Oloni” Olonisakin achieved viral online popularity at the end of 2018 by asking women to send in their stories of sexual adventures, sleeping around with multiple men, and cheating on their boyfriends – then sharing the best she received on Twitter and Instagram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In the escapades she posted, the traditional male-female sex story narrative is reversed; it is the man who is left pining for the woman and the woman who discards romance in return for sex, lots of sex, and purely sex alone. Oloni’s collection of “sex-positive” tales has encouraged women to enjoy lovemaking and to raise their standards without the need for an unsatisfactory relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As well as offering sex tips, Oloni has inspired women to recognise their worth when they do choose to be in a relationship. She regularly tweets, posts and podcasts, urging women to enter a relationship with a man only once they know themselves and are convinced the man in question is not immaturing with age (owing to millennials’ caution, the US divorce rate fell 18 per cent from 2008 to 2016). “In 2019,” Oloni wrote in a tweet that went viral in December, “we are not falling for a man’s potential.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With hook-up culture growing, marriage rates falling (to a record low of 48.6 per cent among Americans aged 18 to 64), and young people discovering the value of independence and self-worth, choosing the single life in 2019 is surely the answer to the quest for personal autonomy in 2018. This year, more women will finally follow the perennial advice of their friends and “dump him”.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--

	&lt;em&gt;Alice Roberts was born in Bristol in 1973. An evolutionary biologist, she is professor of public engagement in science at Birmingham University. She is known for her TV shows “Can Science Make Me Perfect?” and “Prehistoric Autopsy”.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	What’s your earliest memory?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I’m standing at the bottom of a huge flight of stairs, holding a large, soft toy otter. I was in the Mansion House in Bristol, and it must have been 1975 – when my grandfather was Lord Mayor. When I returned as an adult the stairs were impressive, but not as huge as I’d remembered. I still have the otter, rather tattered now, and also much smaller in reality. I would have been two years old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	Who are your heroes?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	My childhood hero was David Attenborough. He opened my eyes to the wonder of the natural world. In fact, he’s still my hero. I interviewed him at the Science Museum in 2015, and he is such a thoughtful, humble and inspiring person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	What was the last book that changed your thinking?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	David Reich’s &lt;em&gt;Who We Are and How We Got Here&lt;/em&gt;. Reich is a geneticist at Harvard, and his book describes the power of genetics to answer big questions about the origin of humans. His work has helped to reveal the mass migration and mixing of populations that has happened through history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	Which political figure do you look up to?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Barack Obama. I felt the world was in safe hands when he was at the helm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	What would be your &lt;em&gt;Mastermind &lt;/em&gt;specialist subject?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I’ve done it! And my specialist subject was “The Moomin Novels of Tove Jansson”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	In which time and place, other than your own, would you like to live?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I’d like to pop along to 2073, to see how my own family is getting on – and also see how we’re getting on with looking after our global family. I’d hope to learn how we’d managed to mitigate the worst effects of climate change and preserve biodiversity. But then I’d come back to now, to all the people I love right here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	What TV show could you not live without?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	None of them. But I’m still looking forward to the next episode of &lt;em&gt;Dynasties&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	What’s your theme tune?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Pixies: “Monkey Gone to Heaven”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	What’s the best advice you’ve received?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Never start revising for an exam more than two weeks before (from my dad).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	What’s currently bugging you?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	How we can get a horse into the Royal Institution for my lectures without it defecating on the floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	When were you happiest?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Moments stand out. On top of Crook Peak on the edge of the Mendips, with two friends and my husband, on the day we got married. The births of both my children – painful of course, but eclipsed by sheer joy. Paddling in kayaks, with my kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	In another life, what job would you have chosen?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I would have stuck to my original plan and become a paediatric surgeon. Or an artist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	Are we all doomed?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As a species – probably. The fate of the vast majority of species on this planet has been extinction, eventually. But I’m optimistic that we can protect ourselves from threats in the near future, at least. We need to stop being so profligate with fossil fuels, to rein back climate change and protect biodiversity. We need to work together, globally, and I’m optimistic that we will. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;Alice Roberts delivered the 2018 Royal Institution Christmas Lectures, broadcast on BBC Four, and is touring in January&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;strong&gt;Self-servative Boris Johnson&lt;/strong&gt; is no team player. Tory MPs predict the blond ego will take his bat and ball away if he fails to succeed Theresa May, rather than standing again in Uxbridge. My smoking room snout whispered that the narcissistic Brextremist couldn’t stomach Jeremy Hunt, Sajid Javid, Penny Mordaunt or Dominic Raab becoming PM. When the serial liar isn’t even the most popular Johnson in parliament – brother Jo enjoys that accolade – a Borexit is surely on the cards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Paranoid purple plotter Nigel Farage&lt;/strong&gt; spots schemes everywhere against Brexit and Donald Trump, yet knows nothing about Russia. His own visit to Julian Assange was, he insists, 100 per cent innocent. Farage sniffed a political hit when Britain’s Brexit-backing former ambassador to the US, Christopher Meyer, was attacked on the London Underground shortly before the president’s visit last July. “He has been doing a lot of media about how important the Trump visit is. Police say it looks like robbery – we’ll see,” tweeted Farage. There was no Trump angle. A teenager, 17, will be sentenced on 10 January after pleading guilty to GBH following a verbal altercation. Now, Nigel, about those questions Robert Mueller would like to ask you…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;The War of the Pugin Room&lt;/strong&gt; is escalating as busybody MPs try to keep unaccompanied peers out of the ornate drinking den before 8pm. Rules posted outside the door are longer than the T&amp;amp;Cs on travel insurance documents. After being asked to leave by an MP he didn’t recognise, “more Andrew than” Adonis is mulling a cross-party sit-in by peers. Rosa Parks would be proud. Or perhaps bemused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;I discovered a Carlton Club row&lt;/strong&gt; was behind Andrew Bridgen walking off live TV to avoid speaking to fellow Conservative MP James Cleverly. Bridgen, a May-baiting Brextremist, was informed by members that not-very Cleverly bad-mouthed him behind his back after being nice to his face. Bridgen was so angry he walked out without paying his bill. This spat could be fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;The Labour MP since 1997&lt;/strong&gt; who received a first Christmas card from Harriet Harman is convinced the wannabe Madam Speaker’s fishing for votes. If so, she wasted a stamp. He’s promised his support to rival Lindsay Hoyle when John Bercow vacates the chair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;A stylish answer from John Major&lt;/strong&gt; when the former PM was recognised on a train. “Are you who I think you are?” enquired a woman. “I used to be,” he replied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Polished and gleaming&lt;/strong&gt;, a Westminster Hall plaque marking Charles I’s 1649 death sentence was refurbished. No wonder Queenie isn’t taken that way for state openings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

	&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-1ddd8cf9-7fff-ef12-e40f-484133e4d8df&quot;&gt;Today we have seen what happens when the government oversteps the mark with rising rail fares – everyone rightly cries foul. Be in no doubt, ministers and rail bosses alike will have heard the crystal-clear voices of protest at stations up and down the land today. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-1ddd8cf9-7fff-ef12-e40f-484133e4d8df&quot;&gt;What a way to start the working week – with a throbbing new year headache caused by outrageous rail fare hikes averaging 3.1 per cent in England and Wales and very nearly 3 per cent in Scotland. That leaves the average commuter paying almost £3,000 more in 2019 for a season ticket – disgraceful and totally unnecessary. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-1ddd8cf9-7fff-ef12-e40f-484133e4d8df&quot;&gt;It’s not as though 2018 was a glorious year when it comes to the performance of this fragmented and largely privatised rail system. Millions of passengers experienced first-hand the utter chaos of timetable changes, which caused such deep and widespread disruption across the railways from May onwards. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-1ddd8cf9-7fff-ef12-e40f-484133e4d8df&quot;&gt;What today tells us is that the game is up for the government and the privateers. We can all see their circus for what it is; clowns fleecing the public, while the shareholders laugh all the way to the bank. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-1ddd8cf9-7fff-ef12-e40f-484133e4d8df&quot;&gt;The biggest clown in the ring is Failing Chris Grayling, of course. The amount by which train companies can raise regulated fares is the responsibility of the Transport Secretary. So, Grayling had the power to stop today’s rises, he just chose not to use it. On BBC Radio 4’s &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;Today&lt;/em&gt; he gave the game away, admitting that under the present system “there are always going to be fare increases because the costs of living rise.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-1ddd8cf9-7fff-ef12-e40f-484133e4d8df&quot;&gt;What Grayling knows, and the public know too, is that were Britain to move to a nationalised railway, it would be a very different picture indeed. Fares would put people not profit first and the network would be run for the people not the privateers.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-1ddd8cf9-7fff-ef12-e40f-484133e4d8df&quot;&gt;This is hardly rocket science – it works very well in other countries, and even the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt; admits that “rail passengers in Britain pay at least twice as much as those in other big European countries”, with travellers here paying 55p a mile over the past year, compared with just 29p in France and an average of 14p across Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-1ddd8cf9-7fff-ef12-e40f-484133e4d8df&quot;&gt;In spite of this, what we have is the perverse spectacle of Grayling re-spinning old news from the Ministry of Gridlock. His pathetic wheeze – half-price railcards for school and college students. Freezing fares for all passengers would be of help to the hard-pressed commuter, but it’s only one part of what it takes to run a railway. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-1ddd8cf9-7fff-ef12-e40f-484133e4d8df&quot;&gt;No passenger believes the Tories have got a clue how to run a rail system and Britain does not need a rail system in which a compensation culture dominates. Rather, it needs a fully integrated service in which trains turn up, run on time and have advisory staff in ticket offices and on platforms. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-1ddd8cf9-7fff-ef12-e40f-484133e4d8df&quot;&gt;In 2019 let’s together – likely under a Labour government – look towards a different kind of railway in our country: one which puts passengers, service and fairness at the heart of the network. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;
	The first time that I caught a glimpse of the anger that has convulsed France in recent months was during a street demonstration in the 14th arrondissement of Paris at the end of October. I wasn’t there to demonstrate myself, but simply to cross the road to reach my office. Nor was I expecting any trouble from the demonstrators, who were mainly middle-aged or older and protesting over pension reforms. I was about halfway through the crowd, however, when I noticed gangs of masked youths, snaking their way through the demonstration; they were well-organised and obviously primed for a fight with the police.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As I made my way to the crossroads at Denfert-Rochereau, I was alarmed to find the road blocked by armed police with riot shields who refused to let me pass. I was then suddenly trapped by a hail of rocks launched at the officers, who immediately responded with tear gas. As I retreated, coughing and spluttering, the image that struck me most powerfully was not the youths attacking the law, but the sight of a respectable-looking, middle-aged man throwing rocks at the police. He was not alone; other people of roughly the same generation and social class were also hurling stones and insults. The protesters – their faces contorted in anger – were intent on inflicting real damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I can’t remember whether I saw any of the now-renowned &lt;em&gt;gilets jaunes &lt;/em&gt;(yellow vests) at this demonstration. But what I did see were the fierce emotions that would trigger a nationwide revolt and shake the confidence of President Emmanuel Macron.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The protests originated in opposition to a planned fuel tax rise (“make our planet great again”, Macron has declared). Protesters showed their solidarity by wearing the &lt;em&gt;gilet jaune&lt;/em&gt; that every French motorist must carry in their car by law. The suspension of the tax rise, and a freeze in energy prices, did not placate the 300,000 protesters, who coalesced into a more unified movement and began demanding higher wages, lower direct taxes and public spending increases. The result is a stand-off between the movement and the government; Macron’s approval rating has reached a new nadir of 18 per cent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	On 10 December, the French president delivered a televised address (watched by 23 million people – more than last year’s World Cup final triumph against Croatia), in which he announced a series of measures designed to regain political credibility and raise living standards. These included a €100 increase in the minimum wage, the abolition of tax and social charges on employee overtime, the exemption of pensioners earning less than €2,000 a month from a new surcharge, and a request for all companies “that can” to award workers a tax-free bonus at the end of 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The response to these concessions was derisive. The &lt;em&gt;gilets jaunes &lt;/em&gt;dismissed them as “crumbs”, with some joking on Facebook: “Macron is offering us &lt;em&gt;cent balles et un Mars&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;em&gt; (&lt;/em&gt;100 quid and a Mars bar). Macron’s measures represent high-handed gestures from the rich to the poor, rather than a genuine anti-austerity programme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The French president has underestimated how profoundly disliked he is by large parts of the electorate. During his national address he appeared nervous at times but also patronising and schoolmasterly. He toyed with – but ultimately resisted – an apology for recent insensitive and careless remarks (such as telling a young unemployed gardener: “I can find you a job just by crossing the road”). It did not help that he delivered his address from the Salon Doré in the Élysée Palace, an opulent gilded chamber that would not have looked out of place in Louis XIV’s court of Versailles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Most dangerously, though Macron is now listening to the protesters, he has shown no sign of retreating from his fundamental economic policy – often likened to Thatcherism – which aspires to a less regulated and more globalised French state. He refused to reinstate the &lt;em&gt;impôt de solidarité sur la fortune &lt;/em&gt;(solidarity tax on wealth), which he abolished in 2017. It is this vision which offends the French street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Macron, who founded his own centrist party, &lt;em&gt;La République En Marche&lt;/em&gt; in 2016, is making a direct challenge to “&lt;em&gt;le social&lt;/em&gt;” – a phrase that is harder to translate than it appears, but refers to the whole nexus of financial and social relationships which every citizen expects as part of their contract with the Republic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	From outside France, this can look like obstinacy and retrograde statism. It is, however, a core element of French identity, which is why so many &lt;em&gt;gilets jaunes&lt;/em&gt; have been waving Tricolore flags and singing “La Marseillaise”. At this symbolic level, the battle is between those who perceive themselves to be properly “French” – the &lt;em&gt;gilets jaunes&lt;/em&gt; who are upholding and defending the values of the Republic – and the “Macronites”, a globalised, English-speaking elite, who know New York and London better than they know the people and places of their own country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	These divisions have recently been defined in a recent book by the French academic and geographer Christophe Guilluy entitled &lt;em&gt;No Society&lt;/em&gt; (a deliberate allusion to Margaret Thatcher) in which he argues that there is no longer a left-right split in France but rather a kind of “American society”, divided between winners and losers. He calls the losers “&lt;em&gt;La France Péripherique&lt;/em&gt;” (“Peripheral France”), a new social class that is cut off from the benefits of 21st-century globalisation but which seethes with the resentments and humiliations of older, more violent forms of class struggle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This may well be mere hyperbole – French intellectuals are hardly known for their restraint in discussing such issues. But there are, as Guilluy and other commentators have observed, deep structural problems in France, which this crisis has brought to the surface. Consequently, the greatest challenge now facing Macron is not to fight his own people, but to try to understand them. &lt;/p&gt;

	On the morning of the first day of the year, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ft.com/content/5121f014-0db8-11e9-a3aa-118c761d2745&quot;&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt; gave us about three seconds to enjoy 2019 before reporting&lt;/a&gt; that Netflix had pulled an episode of its comedy series &lt;em&gt;Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj&lt;/em&gt; in Saudi Arabia, at the request of senior Saudi Arabian officials. In the stand-up set, Minhaj blames the Saudis for the murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi and criticises the government for the ever-changing and dodgy nature of the story, taking particular aim at Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	“The Saudis were struggling to explain his disappearance: they said he left the consulate safely, then they used a body double to make it seem like he was alive,” Minhaj says about the murdered journalist, in the now-removed episode “Saudi Arabia”. “At one point they were saying he died in a fist fight, Jackie Chan-style. They went through so many explanations. The only one they didn’t say was that Khashoggi died in a free solo rock-climbing accident.” &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2019/01/01/681469011/netflix-drops-hasan-minhaj-episode-in-saudi-arabia-at-governments-request&quot;&gt;In an official statement&lt;/a&gt; on the controversy, Netflix claimed that it removed the episode to merely comply with local laws in Saudi Arabia, only pulling it after a “valid legal request”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Articles on this story are dotted with mentions of “outrage” and “denouncement”, particularly from Western Netflix subscribers angry at the streaming service bowing to Saudi interests. The backlash is also underpinned by implied surprise, as if Netflix subscribers were flabbergasted – shocked – that their favourite (read: only) video streaming service was complying with the rules of a questionable governments, instead of providing Saudi subscribers with the content Netflix users can access in any other country in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Is this worth the outrage? Sure. It’s a bad, arguably gross decision made in bad faith by a tech giant branding itself as woke and millennial. But is this decision even remotely surprising? Not in the slightest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I don’t know how many times to say it, or how many different ways to spin it. Even the “nicest” global tech companies (the ones considered to be your most beloved services and apps), do not care about what you want or think if it doesn&#039;t drastically affect their revenue. I’ve written about this before, even as recently as December, when &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/science-tech/social-media/2018/12/tumblr-s-porn-ban-another-case-social-media-sites-misunderstanding&quot;&gt;Tumblr implemented a porn ban&lt;/a&gt;. In the piece, I complained about having to write the same article over and over again, perpetually lamenting tech companies’ short-sighted decisions, spending less time thinking about their reputation amongst their users and a lot more time thinking about greater interests. And, in less than a month, here I am, writing it again. Netflix has shown itself to be no different to its fellow tech giants, displaying a level of cowardice and disregard entirely common in its industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Clearly Tumblr banning porn is not a human rights issue on the scale of murdering a journalist in an embassy. Indeed, many of the issues we&#039;ve seen from tech companies recently (like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/world/asia/2018/11/facebook-thinks-it-might-be-responsible-ethnic-cleansing-myanmar&quot;&gt;Facebook potentially being responsible for ethnic cleansing in Myanmar&lt;/a&gt; and Twitter failing to ban Nazis) affect human rights in very different ways. However, despite their nuances, these issues are all born out of the same problem: tech companies are, on the whole, prioritising influential, lucrative interests over what their users expect, want, and most importantly, actually need. Whether that be investments, ad sales, or powerful governments, tech companies are far less concerned with providing an ethical and responsible platform that keeps their users safe than they are with what&#039;s going to make them money. Losing a couple of principled subscribers over this decision is worth it for Netflix to stay in the good graces of the Saudi kingdom, which controls its access to hundreds of thousands of current subscribers (and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scoop.it/t/market-by-digitaltvnews/p/4096357704/2018/03/31/netflix-dominates-premium-streaming-in-the-middle-east-ott-still-developing-in-africa-ovum&quot;&gt;growing subscriber base&lt;/a&gt;) in the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As much as we might have hoped it was exceptional, Netflix has added itself to that ever-growing list of tech giants ignoring their subscribers’ interests. And this should, really, come as no surprise. Tech companies have long proved themselves to be cowards – why should we expect them to act like anything else?&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;
	The “Channel migrant crisis” is one of those strange political phrases where almost every part feels like it ought to come with an asterisk. Most of the people seeking to cross from France to the United Kingdom via a series of unreliable and makeshift boats are not migrants, but refugees. And just over 100 people seeking to come to a country of almost 70 million (with near full employment and the fifth biggest economy in the world) hardly constitutes a crisis. Perhaps we should be grateful that these crossings, are, at least, taking place in the stretch of water between France and the United Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Part of the row is nakedly political. The Home Secretary Sajid Javid, who was criticised for not ending a safari holiday immediately to “manage the situation”, is generally considered to be one of the frontrunners for the Conservative leadership. Since Theresa May conceded before Christmas that she would not serve a full term, that race has intensified. The other leading contender to replace her, Jeremy Hunt, interrupted his festive break with an article in the &lt;em&gt;Mail on Sunday&lt;/em&gt; talking up the benefits of Brexit and the joys of the Singapore model, a place many pro-Leave Tory MPs regard as the shining city in a swamp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One of Javid’s fellow cabinet ministers mused to me shortly before the holidays that Javid and Hunt had “peaked too soon and have a target on their back”. Much of the blue-on-blue sniping at the Home Secretary is about hobbling a rival rather than a serious critique of his handling of the affair. However, anyone who has bought stock in Javid should note with alarm the lack of supportive voices from within the parliamentary party taking to the airwaves (or even Twitter) to stick up for him. Javid, like Hunt, has supporters but no real devotees. Both are therefore still vulnerable to an unexpected candidate who truly finds a way to animate Tory MPs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Where Javid isn’t vulnerable to attack is from the opposition. His Labour shadow, Diane Abbott, has set out proposals that would radically change how refugees and migrants are treated by the British state: these include closing the women’s immigration detention centre at Yarl’s Wood, and scrapping the net migration target. However, Abbott knows the risks of making a pro-migration argument explicitly and has therefore dodged a full-blown confrontation with Javid here. Her criticisms have cleaved to Labour’s default setting on security and migration: complaining that the government isn’t spending more money on fences and guards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Across Europe, there are high levels of concern about border security, even though the numbers of migrants are often derisory in comparison to the host country’s overall population. Italy, with a population of 60 million, never had to deal with annual inflows of more than 200,000 even at the peak of the crisis. Germany took in just over a million refugees between 2015 and 2016 – but has a population of more than 80 million and is the largest economy in the European Union. At the height of the crisis in 2015, Austria – which had more asylum claims per capita than any other European country – only received 90,000 in a nation of nine million: fewer migrants per head than London manages to absorb every year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Yet even these comparatively small figures have triggered major political eruptions. In Italy, the far right Lega Nord has taken power and is now the dominant force on the political right. In Austria, the centre right People’s Party is in coalition with the far right and its leader, Sebastian Kurz, has aped much of the rhetoric and the policy programme of his governing partners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Here in the United Kingdom, Vote Leave sought to tap into anxieties about migration during the 2016 referendum campaign by warning about the entirely illusory possibility that Turkey would soon join the European Union. The reality is that there is more chance of a successful Turkish mission to the moon by 2030 than there is of Turkish accession to the EU. As David Cameron pointed out during the campaign – to absolutely no effect – by staying in the EU, Britain would have had a veto on the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Cameron’s successor, Theresa May, has copied his attitude to the European migrant crisis. Their response was summarised by Ivan Rogers, who was Cameron’s top civil servant in Brussels, in a lecture to the University of Liverpool on 13 December, as “we have an opt-out from that one”. In other words: thanks to the Channel, refugees are the Continent’s problem, not ours. The British government has happily handed out cash to the parts of Europe where people have arrived, but that is basically it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Yet the nations on the European border are becoming increasingly unwilling to shoulder the responsibility of dealing with mass migration alone. Brexit might see us leave the European Union, but it will not allow us to swerve the effects of global migration caused by political instability (such as the war in Syria) and climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	These are the two greatest drivers of movement, although neither of them are inevitable or unmanageable forces – an argument that Cameron made at the launch of a new pro-international development organisation, the Coalition for Global Prosperity, on 7 June. However, if the nations of the global south become uninhabitable due to poverty, war or a changing climate over the course of the century, its residents will have no alternative but to move into the developed world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	How can it be said that Britain is ready for this, if a few dozen refugees in the Channel prompt a political storm and require the personal attention of the Home Secretary? The real story of those rickety boats is not the Tory party’s endless in-fighting, but the way they predict our political future.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--

    <title>Howard Jacobson’s Diary: I turn on the radio, primed for apoplexy, and discover only family entertainment</title>

	Having spent the year complaining that every day begins with a snakepit of Leavers hissing their support for the Will of the People, and my wife saying “then don’t turn on the radio”, I turn on the radio and am disappointed to find only innocuous family entertainment. Has there been a coup? Then I remember – it’s Christmas Day. Ho Ho Ho. All very well, but I’ve been programmed for apoplexy since 2016 and can’t function without some idiocy to shout down. Shaking the parboiled potatoes in a pan to fluff up their edges uses up some rage – though I have to start again when I see I have fluffed the potatoes to a dry mash – and after a sit-down with my head in my hands I realise I have stumbled on the real meaning of Christmas. Peace. For one whole half hour I have not seen the faces of those lying, scheming, conniving, despicable, reprehensible scumbags who claim to be acting in the national interest. A hundred more Christmases and I might forget the sound of their voices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	Wages of sin&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The weather being mild, I take a morning stroll through Soho. It’s lovely with everything closed and none of the desperate merry-making of its evening self. I am not turning against what Soho’s for. If anything I regret how much of its lubriciousness has been lost to bubble tea, designer trainer shops and truffle-makers: we didn’t come to Soho when I was young to blow our student grants on running shoes and sea-salted caramels. But even what night-raving remains lacks spontaneity. Everyone is trying too hard. The effect, I suspect, of wanting not to face where those despicable, reprehensible etc etc scumbags are taking us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	On the prowl&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There are fewer shops in Soho selling torture equipment than there used to be. Who needs artificial pain when there’s so much of the real thing around? A nicely dressed family of tourists – Mama, Papa, and three children aged from about five to ten in matching scarves – stare into the window of Prowler, scrutinising the fetish wares. I think I hear the youngest asking, “Did you wear a nipple clamp before you had us, Daddy?” but I might be mistaken. A more gregarious person would wish them Merry Christmas and point them in the direction of the truffle shop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	Courting approval&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I settle down to watch &lt;em&gt;RBG&lt;/em&gt;, a documentary about Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, whose only error of judgement in a long life of scrupulous advocacy has been to publicly call Trump a “faker”. Not much of an error compared to voting for him. Halfway through I find myself fighting back tears. Nothing is more moving than a life dedicated to seriousness. Even as a young woman that seriousness burned in her face like the beauty of thought. Which isn’t to say she can’t be funny. In Venice recently I watched her preside over a staged retrial of Shylock. She was so small you could barely see her above the bench. She found in Shylock’s favour, naturally, awarding him his original 3,000 ducats – on which she was not prepared to calculate the 400 years of interest – and sending Portia for correction in the finer points of court procedure to Padua University’s Law School. You can be funny without being frivolous. I think of Dorothea Brooke in &lt;em&gt;Middlemarch&lt;/em&gt;, also unfrivolous and dedicated to doing good, but unfulfilled. What would she have given to be Ruth Bader Ginsburg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	Too many tweets&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Banks open and &lt;em&gt;Today&lt;/em&gt; programme back to normal. The villainous seem not to have returned from their holidays as far away as possible from the people they pretend to revere, but there are other exasperations. The moment a conversation turns interesting the presenter asks the speaker to be brief as they are running out of time. To which the only answer is: “If there’s no effing time to discuss what I’m here to discuss, why did you invite me to discuss it in the first place, and – and! – why is so much of the little time there is taken up by your interruptions?” This edition is guest-edited by Martha Lane Fox, who is “on the board of Twitter”. What is it about that phrase that is so sublimely absurd? The board of Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	World of Light&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I have tuned in to catch the score from the Boxing Day Test Match in Melbourne. Australia vs India. Though I love most things Australian I don’t love their cricket teams and like them to be thrashed. But they are devils, Australian cricketers, and don’t succumb to defeat as meekly as English cricketers, who are born masochists and probably buy their protectors from Prowler. I have a particular, and particularly sad, interest in the Boxing Day Test this year. In past times, whenever I visited Melbourne I’d go to the Tests with Geoff Missen, a geographer, painter, lover of Matisse, and true fauvist in himself. He is one of three Australian men I have loved who died in the last 12 months. It is only right, now I have named him, that I name the others: Peter Shrubb, short-story writer, teacher, paterfamilias, second father to me; and Peter Nicholls, an old combatant mate, wholly original, and co-editor of &lt;em&gt;The Encyclopaedia of Science Fiction&lt;/em&gt; – an enterprise I had no reason to scorn, but did, mainly because I liked the drunken arguments that ensued, pitting Isaac Asimov against Jane Austen. One way or another they animated my life for five decades. Now they are all gone into the World of Light…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	Radio gaga&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I wake shouting at the radio before it’s on. “So will you still uphold the democratic rights of the people when they vote to sack the houses of the wealthy, Mr Rees-Mogg?” My wife proposes a calming walk in the park. Lovely idea. “So tell me,” I ask one of the smaller birds, “how do you fancy a seat on the board of Twitter?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;Howard Jacobson is the author of “Pussy” and “Shylock is My Name”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--

    <title>January’s increase in rail fares isn’t that huge – but commuters are still right to be angry</title>
    <link>https://www.newstatesman.com/2019/01/january-s-increase-rail-fares-isn-t-huge-commuters-are-still-right-be-angry</link>

	It feels like a peculiarly British joke that the annual rise in rail fares happens at the exact point in the year when commuters are least enthusiastic about getting on a train and going to work. The first week back after Christmas is generally ghastly, even if you’re lucky enough to like your job: throw in an unavoidable increase in the cost of getting there, and it comes with an effective pay cut as well. Why anyone would bother doing dry January too is a mystery to me. Perhaps they can’t afford to drink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	All that said, my hipster, controversialist, admittedly-not-a-person-who-needs-to-buy-a-season-ticket-to-do-my-job take on this week’s rail fare increase is – it’s not that bad. The campaign group Railfuture has described it as “yet another kick in the wallet”. But the actual scale of the increase – which averages 3.1 per cent in England and Wales, and 3 per cent in Scotland – is not that huge. It’s less than a point above the recent inflation: if that was the rate house prices increased by, millennials would be delighted. This &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; feel like a win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	And yet it quite clearly doesn’t. Why not?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One possibility is that “rail fares rise, commuters angry” is as well-worn a seasonal story as “council bans Christmas” or “snow causes chaos”: news desks are so much in the habit of sending reporters after this one they haven’t stopped to consider if it’s a valid complaint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Another explanation relates to matters of geography and class. Regular train travel is actually a minority sport in Britain – &lt;a href=&quot;https://yougov.co.uk/topics/transport/articles-reports/2018/12/31/four-ten-brits-havent-set-foot-train-last-12-month?utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_medium=website_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=train_travel&quot;&gt;research published by YouGov&lt;/a&gt; earlier this week shows that four in 10 Brits haven’t even set even foot on a train in the last year. The percentage of people who actually commute by rail is in single figures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	And yet, we obsess about the rail network, while ignoring the more widely used buses. Why? Because most of those commuting by train are heading for London – which just so happens to be where all the journalists and politicians are. Bus fares are also appalling – but those they affect simply aren’t as visible to the ruling class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One side effect of this is that rail passengers tend, by national standards, to be relatively rich. This raises the uncomfortable possibility that reducing rail subsidies, by gradually increasing fares, might actually be the more progressive thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But, for two reasons, I don’t think it is: actually, I think commuters have a perfect right to be a bit pissed off that fares are going up by 3 per cent yet again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One problem is the state of the railways themselves. For many months now they’ve been in a mess. New cross-city infrastructure in both London and Manchester was meant to lead to an increase in services and journey opportunities; what it&lt;em&gt; actually &lt;/em&gt;led to was months of chaos and cancellations and lengthy statements from Chris Grayling explaining why, contrary to appearances, none of it was his fault. To someone who’s been trying to fight their way onto a two-car bus on rails every morning for the last year, the fact Northern managed to raise their fares before it managed to provide the service for which it was contracted just adds insult to injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The other reason anger over rail fare increases is justified relates to the wider economy. A 3 per cent increase in fares may not sound unreasonable – but by the same token, neither would a 3 per cent increase in wages. The latter, however, has not been forthcoming for many years, and that situation doesn’t soon seem likely to change. Under such circumstances, being told it’s going to cost you more just for the privilege of getting to your increasingly underpaid job just feels like taking the piss.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--

    <title>2019 – the big questions: Will the far right triumph in Europe?</title>
    <link>https://www.newstatesman.com/world/europe/2019/01/2019-big-questions-will-far-right-triumph-europe</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-subheadline field-type-text-long field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;
	On 23 May, Europe will elect 705 representatives for almost 450 million people. With nationalist, anti-immigrant populism ascendant, this will be a decisive moment for the continent. &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-node-image field-type-image field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;noscript class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoints=&quot;300 768 1024&quot; data-adaptive-image-300-img=&quot;&amp;lt;img class=&amp;quot;adaptive-image&amp;quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&amp;quot;300&amp;quot; typeof=&amp;quot;foaf:Image&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/lead_image/public/Longreads_2019/01/2019_01_far_right_paul_mason.jpg?itok=f-tLxb4K&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&quot; data-adaptive-image-768-img=&quot;&amp;lt;img class=&amp;quot;adaptive-image&amp;quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&amp;quot;768&amp;quot; typeof=&amp;quot;foaf:Image&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/lead_image/public/Longreads_2019/01/2019_01_far_right_paul_mason.jpg?itok=f-tLxb4K&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&quot; data-adaptive-image-1024-img=&quot;&amp;lt;img class=&amp;quot;adaptive-image&amp;quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&amp;quot;1024&amp;quot; typeof=&amp;quot;foaf:Image&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/lead_image/public/Longreads_2019/01/2019_01_far_right_paul_mason.jpg?itok=f-tLxb4K&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&quot; data-adaptive-image-max-img=&quot;&amp;lt;img class=&amp;quot;adaptive-image&amp;quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&amp;quot;max&amp;quot; typeof=&amp;quot;foaf:Image&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/lead_image/public/Longreads_2019/01/2019_01_far_right_paul_mason.jpg?itok=f-tLxb4K&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&quot;&gt;&lt;img typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/Longreads_2019/01/2019_01_far_right_paul_mason.jpg?itok=gnODxGA9&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;
	Only one thing is certain about the 2019 elections to the European Parliament: the outcome will be neither free nor fair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It doesn’t matter how scrupulously the ballots are counted in Stockholm or how equally the time is allocated to parties on Dutch TV. As long as Hungary participates, the parliament elected on 26 May will contain MEPs who owe their seats to the lies, coercion and corruption practised by the government of Viktor Orbán.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Hungarian prime minister indirectly controls 500 media outlets and influences almost all TV coverage of politics. When there are mass demonstrations against him in Budapest, Hungarian state TV instead shows demonstrations against migrants by Belgian fascists. Orbán has used taxpayers’ money to stage referendums against the non-existent “Soros plan” to flood Europe with refugees, to plaster Budapest with anti-Semitic billboards, and to gain 91 of 106 directly elected seats in Hungary’s parliament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Orbán, to put it plainly, is using the money of the Hungarian state, itself heavily financed by European grants, not only to influence the election of Hungary’s 24 MEPs but – in a state-funded propaganda and influence campaign – to distort the outcome across Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But the Hungarian case is just part of a wider crisis for Europe’s liberal centrist political elites. Analysis of national opinion polls show the far right is set to surge during the May elections. Marine Le Pen’s Rassemblement National is polling at 21 per cent; Italy’s Lega Nord is on 30 per cent. Europe of Nations and Freedom (ENF), the right-wing populist group in the European Parliament to which both parties are affiliated is expected to win 51 seats, while Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy (EFDD), a Eurosceptic outfit containing Germany’s Alternative für Deutschland and an assortment of former Front National and Ukip MEPs, is predicted to win 50.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The authoritarian right will emerge as a pan-European force in the run-up to May. Its agitation has already forced eight European governments to reject the UN’s global compact on migration last month and will, this year, redraw the political map of Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;rtecenter&quot;&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;****&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The centre itself is in disarray, and is being pulled inexorably towards the agenda of the far right. Angela Merkel runs a zombie coalition in Berlin, but restive voices within her government want a “conservative revolution”, which would roll back the gains of social liberalism to a pre-1968 condition. In France President Macron’s reform project – a bit less austerity in return for allowing market forces to destroy the living standards of the working class – has run into the barricades of the &lt;em&gt;gilets jaunes&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The European People’s Party (EPP) group, which brings together traditional conservative parties, is itself moving to the right. It still contains Orbán’s Fidesz party, along with Austria’s Österreichische Volkspartei, which governs in coalition with the far right, and Spain’s Partido Popular, whose leading lights cannot bring themselves to stop worshipping at the tomb of Franco.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If the far right wins 100 seats in the new European parliament this year, and the EPP group’s drift to nationalism and xenophobia continues, it is safe to say the projects of integration and social liberalism will be on hold. The idea of “European sovereignty” promoted by the president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, will be dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Social democratic parties, meanwhile, are facing a mixture of electoral decline and challenge from both the greens and the left. Only Portugal, where the Socialist Party holds 37 per cent of seats and leads a coalition government with the far left, has bucked the trend. Sweden’s social democrats, down to 28 per cent of the vote in last year’s election, cling precariously to power in a caretaker government. Elsewhere, the typical fate of the classic social democrat parties, for example in Austria and Denmark, is to hover around 25 per cent. In both Germany and Italy, where strong social democracy was a lynchpin of the postwar anti-fascist settlement, support for social democrats has slumped below 20 per cent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Further to the left you find, in Europe’s mature democracies, left parties and leftish greens competing in the same space. The most successful left parties in Europe are Syriza in Greece, which remains in government and is polling at 25 per cent, and Sinn Fein, which has veered between 14 and 24 per cent since the Brexit crisis began last autumn. Of the other influential parties on the European left, Spain’s Podemos is polling at 16 per cent, but the socialist majority is being eroded both by the conservative Partido Popular and the nascent far-right Vox party. Jean-Luc Mélenchon’s La France Insoumise polls at around 13 per cent, while both Germany’s Linke (Left Party) and the Portuguese Left Bloc poll at around 9 per cent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The big picture, which will be unmistakable once votes are cast in May, is of a continent being pulled rightwards: by authoritarian nationalist movements, by a millionaire-owned media for whom racism is a money-spinner, and by the information wars waged by Trump and Putin supporters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	And yet, few parties want to dismantle the European project itself. Authoritarian nationalists flirt with the economics of the left when they play to their social conservatism and anti-globalism, but most far-right parties want to deregulate the single market, rather than leave it. In 2017 Hungary itself received €3.23bn more from the EU than it contributed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A European parliament dominated by the right, however, would find it difficult to work with national governments rejecting both liberalism and ever closer union. The European Council would come to resemble the UN Security Council – paralysed by de facto vetoes. Instead of overriding the petty squabbles between nations, the European Commission would itself become a battleground. Meanwhile, the parliament would become an echo chamber for neo-Nazis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If this outcome – fragmentation of the council, the commission and the parliament – were accidental it would be one thing. But it is the product of design. It is Vladimir Putin’s express wish that Europe’s geopolitics become “multipolar” – that is, for Europe to become a chessboard over which America, China and Russia fight for influence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	And those who want to tear Europe into spheres of influence have a strong rationale. Of all the world’s economic superpowers, Europe is the one that does not have a cohesive bourgeois class. The US has Wall Street, Big Oil and Silicon Valley; Russia has the &lt;em&gt;siloviki&lt;/em&gt; class of politicians with a security services or military background, and the oligarchs; China has the Communist princelings and their huge business empires. The European bourgeoisie has automobiles, an empire of luxury brands and some state-supported banks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Take, for example, the attitudes taken to artificial intelligence, a technology widely expected to be as influential in the coming decades as the internet has been in the recent past. In its development, America and China will compete as industrial superpowers; Russia, Israel and South Korea will compete as military specialists; Europe’s plan is to have a good long think about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In the global economy, the “sovereignty” of Juncker’s catchphrase is conferred not by political agreement but by powerful business elites. Without its own Silicon Valley or oligarchy, Europe currently suffers from a lack of geopolitical clout, especially when it comes to forcing social media giants to stop funnelling hate speech and disinformation into European politics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;rtecenter&quot;&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;****&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	What is the solution? It is surely this: for the centre-left and the radical left to seek tactical unity with as many green and liberal parties as possible to defend democracy, suppress fascism and end austerity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I know what prevents this, because I have discussed the idea personally with the people who could make it happen: it is the Lisbon Treaty of 2009. The technocrats of the centre left cannot think beyond its strictures, which prevent the aggressive growth strategies, state aid and industrial policy practised by the other big economic blocs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The political struggle, before and after the 2019 elections, is to encourage realism and tactical compromise among all those with an interest in defending the rule of law and the multilateral institutions that underpin it. In the 1930s it was the left that initiated such a compromise, in the form of the Comintern’s Popular Front strategy to oppose fascism. Today, it’s hard to get the leaders of the European radical left to occupy the same room, let alone persuade social democratic politicians to collaborate with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There is, however, one wild-card option with a non-negligible chance of happening: Theresa May falls, a second referendum cancels Brexit, Article 50 is revoked, Britain elects new MEPs and a new, left-led British government appoints a commissioner to match its politics. A unilateral cancellation of Brexit would merely leave Britain with all its rights under the status quo: but it would alter the dynamics of Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Because even at 40 per cent of the vote, a new raft of left-affiliated MEPs would shift the balance in the parliament, while a feisty, communicative left commissioner from the fifth-largest economy in the world would tilt the balance there. But I am not promising that a Labour/SNP government could ride to Europe’s rescue. Whatever happens, politics in Brussels and Strasbourg are about to swing to the dark side.&lt;/p&gt;

	Interviewed on &lt;em&gt;The Culture Show&lt;/em&gt; in 2008, David Simon let viewers in on a little secret about his HBO show &lt;em&gt;The Wire&lt;/em&gt;. Citing the show’s novelistic approach to storytelling – with a lack of exposition, and complex, multi-layered plots – host Lauren Laverne asked him about the “contempt” &lt;em&gt;The Wire&lt;/em&gt; showed for the average viewer. “What about the casual viewer?” she said, bewildered. “People who want to dip in, dip out?” Simon just shook his head. Looking over his shoulder, and leaning forward conspiratorially, he whispered: “Fuck the casual viewer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It was a controversial statement, not least because broadcast television was specifically designed to accommodate the casual viewer. As the former TV producer John Ellis, now professor of media arts at Royal Holloway, London, wrote in 1982, typically, television was supposed to be “a casual experience rather than an intensive one”. Because it was intended to be watched at home, TV could not “assume the same level of attention from its viewers that cinema can from its spectators”. For Ellis, proof of this was the simple fact that broadcast TV in the 20th century had not “produced a group of telephiles to match the cinephiles who have seen everything and know the least inconsequential detail” about prestige cinema – an aside that now seems thrillingly out of date. When &lt;em&gt;The Wire&lt;/em&gt; was being made in the early Noughties, the idea that you could deliberately alienate the majority of TV viewers and go in search of a more devoted audience seemed radically new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Ten years later, viewing habits are no longer casual. Thanks to pioneering subscription-model channels such as HBO (which also made &lt;em&gt;The Sopranos&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Girls&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt;) and AMC (&lt;em&gt;Mad Men&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Breaking Bad&lt;/em&gt;), and subscription streaming services such as Netflix (&lt;em&gt;House of Cards&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Crown&lt;/em&gt;) and Amazon (&lt;em&gt;Transparent&lt;/em&gt;), the television landscape has been transformed. The word “binge-watching” has entered the mainstream lexicon. We’re happy to consume longer, more complex and slower-paced multi-episode television shows that demand greater attention. We’ll take on the challenge of more difficult characters, or persist with shows after favourites are killed off. We’ll accept shows that suddenly reinvent themselves, changing their setting, premise or tone. Ten years after David Simon said “fuck you” to the casual viewer, television is defined instead by the avid viewer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	What does this mean for broadcast television, vying for the attention of a consumer who has changed beyond recognition? And could 2019 be the year that terrestrial network television crumbles? The data looks bleak. As numbers of those using digital streaming services rise, more people are cutting back on broadcast subscriptions. In November, the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; reported that a million Americans had cancelled their cable or satellite subscriptions between July and September – one of the largest ever seasonal drops. It estimated that ten million US households had stopped paying for cable or satellite TV since 2010, when traditional TV subscriptions were at their peak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In the UK, things aren’t looking much better for broadcast TV. Ofcom reported that early last year digital streaming overtook traditional television for the first time – there are now more UK subscriptions to Netflix, Amazon and Now TV (15.4 million) than to traditional “pay TV” services such as those offered by Sky, Virgin Media, BT and TalkTalk (15.1 million). This does not include BBC licence fee payers, of which there are significantly more (25.8 million as of 2017). But there are reasons for the BBC to be worried by the rise of streaming: between 2013 and 2017, a record 3.5 million UK residents cancelled their licence fee – a rate of almost one million a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Increasingly, viewers seek out the kind of TV shows streaming services are making: more than a third of Netflix subscribers surveyed said they signed up to watch Netflix “Originals” (new shows and films made by Netflix such as &lt;em&gt;The Crown&lt;/em&gt;, rather than existing ones licensed to the service, such as &lt;em&gt;Friends&lt;/em&gt;), demonstrating that viewers see the service as a producer of quality original content worth paying for, and not simply as a digital library of licensed programming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If viewers already consider digital streaming to be a rival source of high-quality original shows, that perception could increase significantly over the next year. Ofcom observed in its first annual Media Nations report that spending by the BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5 on new UK-made television programmes fell to a 20-year low in 2017, at a collective spend of £2.5bn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It’s a particularly worrying statistic as more and more money is ploughed into big-budget competition from digital streaming services, which are only increasing their investment in new programming. In 2018, 85 per cent of spending by Netflix was on original content. According to the &lt;em&gt;Economist, &lt;/em&gt;citing data from a Goldman Sachs assessment, that amounts to as much as $13bn. That’s significantly more than any US broadcaster, and more than four times that of all the UK’s biggest traditional networks combined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Subscribers to digital streaming services get shows with extravagantly higher budgets: gorgeous sets and exotic locations, more famous faces, and more expensive industry talent, empowered to take greater risks. But there’s also less pressure on individual shows to bring in millions of viewers. Freed from the shackles of prime-time schedules, streaming services personalise user home pages based on viewing history – so they only see shows they are likely to watch. Netflix identifies “taste clusters”, grouping viewers together and pushing them towards what they may be interested in. This way, the kind of shows that could underwhelm in a traditional mainstream schedule can have a new kind of targeted appeal online. (Take &lt;em&gt;The Curious Creations of Christine McConnell&lt;/em&gt;: a spooky baking show produced by the Jim Henson Company, featuring creepy cakes and talking puppets.) This should also mean fewer disappointed viewers, because, in theory, you won’t be nudged towards the kinds of shows you have no history of watching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The competition for broadcast television is becoming ever more intense. Last year, YouTube launched a subscription-based streaming service, YouTube Premium, featuring a multimillion-dollar flagship sci-fi show called &lt;em&gt;Origin&lt;/em&gt;. Facebook put more weight behind its own service, Facebook Watch, with a US remake of a globally successful Norwegian show called &lt;em&gt;Skam&lt;/em&gt; and with &lt;em&gt;Queen America&lt;/em&gt;, a dark comedy starring Catherine Zeta-Jones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In late 2019, Disney is set to launch its own streaming service, Disney+ (which will be the home of all Disney’s output, including its own acquisitions: the Marvel superhero and &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; films and shows and, as it is set to finish a deal with 20th Century Fox, anything from &lt;em&gt;X-Men&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;The Simpsons&lt;/em&gt;). AT&amp;amp;T’s WarnerMedia is launching its own service this year, as is Apple – with Reese Witherspoon, Steven Spielberg, Damien Chazelle and more signed up to projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But the sheer proliferation of content could mean digital streaming creates its own downfall. In 2015, John Landgraf, chief executive of the broadcast network FX, coined the phrase “peak TV”: there was too much to watch and audiences were becoming exhausted. And last year he said “the golden age of television has become the gilded age of television”, predicting that the bubble would burst.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Perhaps there’s some truth in this. After spending millions on &lt;em&gt;Origin&lt;/em&gt; only for it to be poorly received, YouTube is, according to the &lt;em&gt;Hollywood Reporter&lt;/em&gt;, significantly scaling back its spending on scripted shows, and moving away from a subscription model. Facebook and Apple could face a similar problem, finding that big spending doesn’t necessarily translate into big viewing figures. Netflix itself, while its subscriber numbers, revenue and earnings continue to rise, also set a record for negative free cash flow in the third quarter last year: it spent $859m more making films and shows than its 130 million subscribers paid to watch them. Shares of the so-called Faang companies (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google) dipped in 2018, with Netflix shares down by 37 per cent between July and December. Bloomberg fears that the continuous success story of Faang stocks could “collapse” in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The expansion of television means audiences won’t settle for repetitive programming. Soaps such as the BBC’s &lt;em&gt;EastEnders&lt;/em&gt; have haemorrhaged millions of viewers over the past decade, as have tired reality and entertainment formats such as ITV’s &lt;em&gt;The X Factor&lt;/em&gt;. But original formats, revitalised legacy programmes and new glossy dramas such as BBC’s &lt;em&gt;Bodyguard &lt;/em&gt;have attracted viewing numbers the streaming services would envy. &lt;em&gt;Bodyguard&lt;/em&gt; finale became the most-watched episode of any drama in the UK since 2002, with 17.1 million people watching over 28 days. By comparison, 16 million people stream &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt; on HBO (which begins its final series in April). Netflix keeps its viewing figures a closely guarded secret but according to some estimates, these are far higher figures than most Netflix shows. (The second series of &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things&lt;/em&gt; secured 15 million viewers in the first three days of airing in October 2017, and was the closest thing to a water-cooler show Netflix has had.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Streaming giants are offering a version of TV that is more intense, more varied and more personalised than ever before. So perhaps legacy broadcasters can survive by sticking to their strengths. If TV viewing has become less casual, the desire to read about, talk about and analyse TV has increased dramatically (as the rise of online TV recaps and podcasts demonstrate). In April 2018, David Clementi, chairman of the BBC, acknowledged the extreme challenges faced by the corporation in maintaining (particularly younger) viewers in the digital age. “The BBC is at its strongest when we unite age groups to share national moments,” he said, emphasising its social role and how some programmes – a royal wedding, the World Cup, a popular drama – bring people together. There’s no doubt that we are still hungry for television that cuts through “taste clusters” and becomes part of the national conversation. Done well, “event” television could hold the key to broadcast television’s survival.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;
	Where is David Cameron right now? In his £25,000 shepherd’s hut, beavering away on his book, or somewhere sunny with – in Danny Dyer’s immortal words – “his trotters up”? It feels like we have been waiting for the former PM’s memoir almost as long as we have been waiting for Cormac McCarthy’s new novel, or for the Smiths to reform. Harper-Collins has slated it for the autumn, but if Brexit is delayed then it may be bumped on again: Cameron wants the book to appear after the smoke has cleared, in the hope that everyone forgets who started the fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Meanwhile, after eight years of Conservative government, publishers are looking to the left for attention-grabbing new ideas. In &lt;em&gt;Clear Bright Future: A Radical Defence of the Human Being&lt;/em&gt; (Allen Lane, May) Paul Mason, who writes for the &lt;em&gt;NS&lt;/em&gt;, tackles a new world order characterised by authoritarian regimes and increasing intolerance, in which the very idea of universal human rights is under threat. Aaron Bastani, co-founder of Novara Media, coined the phrase “fully automated luxury communism” a few years ago: now it is a manifesto, coming from Verso in June, outlining how new technologies could liberate us from work and therefore capitalism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As Brexit continues to dominate politics, Diarmaid Ferriter’s &lt;em&gt;The Border: The Legacy of a Century of Anglo-Irish Politics &lt;/em&gt;(Profile, February) is timely, though in a country bruised by years of austerity, writers are still exploring class and inequality. Kerry Hudson’s memoir &lt;em&gt;Lowborn: Growing Up, Getting Away and Returning to Britain’s Poorest Towns &lt;/em&gt;(Chatto &amp;amp; Windus, May); &lt;em&gt;Who Owns England? &lt;/em&gt;(William Collins, May), Guy Shrubsole’s history of how England’s elite came to own our land; and &lt;em&gt;Not Working: Where Have All the Good Jobs Gone? &lt;/em&gt;by the economist David Blanchflower (Princeton, June) all arrive with a sense of urgency. (An argument &lt;em&gt;against&lt;/em&gt; urgency can be found in Josh Cohen’s &lt;em&gt;Not Working: Why We Have to Stop (&lt;/em&gt;Granta, January), a defence of the vanishing art of doing nothing.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In today’s political climate, we don’t need much encouragement to retreat to the past. Half a century ago it was 1969, the year of Woodstock, &lt;em&gt;Portnoy’s Complaint&lt;/em&gt;, Monty Python’s debut,&lt;em&gt; Abbey Road&lt;/em&gt; and, of course, mankind’s giant leap. &lt;em&gt;Chasing the Moon &lt;/em&gt;by Robert Stone and Alan Andres (William Collins, June) and &lt;em&gt;Escape from Earth &lt;/em&gt;by Fraser MacDonald (Profile, June) tell the story, with the latter exploring the darker corners of America’s first space programme, which was apparently riddled with communism, drugs and occult sex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A further 20 years back takes us to 1949 and the publication of George Orwell’s &lt;em&gt;Nineteen Eighty-Four&lt;/em&gt;, a novel that has returned to the bestseller lists in the era of Trump and Brexit. Dorian Lynskey’s&lt;em&gt; The Ministry of Truth &lt;/em&gt;(Picador, May) explores both the book’s roots and its long shadow. Orwell was born in India, but was installed at Eton by 1919, when in Amritsar troops fired into a crowd, killing hundreds of civilians. The centenary of the massacre is marked by Anita Anand’s &lt;em&gt;The Patient Assassin &lt;/em&gt;(Simon &amp;amp; Schuster, April), which uncovers the fascinating story of an Indian survivor who vowed to kill those responsible. The crimes of the coloniser are also explored in William Dalrymple’s &lt;em&gt;The Anarchy&lt;/em&gt; (Bloomsbury, October), detailing the rise of the notorious East India Company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Grand historical narratives of East and West are supplied by Tim Mackintosh-Smith in &lt;em&gt;Arabs: A 3,000 Year History of Peoples, Tribes and Empires&lt;/em&gt; (Yale, March) and Tom Holland in &lt;em&gt;Dominion&lt;/em&gt; (Little, Brown, September), which explains the role of Christianity in shaping “the Western mind”, from Nebuchadnezzar to the Beatles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Epic lives come to light this year. &lt;em&gt;Eric Hobsbawm: A Life in History &lt;/em&gt;by Richard J Evans (Little, Brown, February) will frame the great historian (and &lt;em&gt;NS&lt;/em&gt; jazz critic) as a participant in his own times (he acted as an interpreter for Che Guevara in Cuba) as well as a chronicler of the past. Hobsbawm’s near-contemporary Lucian Freud died in 2011: much has been written about him since, but this year brings the first volume of a landmark biography (Bloomsbury, September) by William Feaver, who spoke to Freud on the phone for at least an hour a day for almost 40 years. Do we need another life of Hitler? If it’s written by Brendan Simms, a historian and &lt;em&gt;NS&lt;/em&gt; contributing writer with an appetite for the big questions, then the answer is yes: his &lt;em&gt;Only the World Was Enough&lt;/em&gt; (Allen Lane, August) digs deep to discover the origins of Hitler’s ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The most epic narrative of our time may turn out to be climate change, and writers are finally – too late, perhaps – working out a way to tell its story. Based on a piece published in the &lt;em&gt;New York Times &lt;/em&gt;magazine, Nathaniel Rich’s &lt;em&gt;Losing Earth&lt;/em&gt; (Picador, April) looks at the decade spanning 1979-89, when the science of global warming was settled and we could have stopped it – but didn’t. Rich asks what that failure means for us today. See also: &lt;em&gt;The Uninhabitable Earth&lt;/em&gt; by David Wallace-Wells (Allen Lane, February). We can but hope there are some lessons for our damaged planet in Jared Diamond’s &lt;em&gt;Upheaval: How Nations Cope with Crisis and Change&lt;/em&gt; (Allen Lane, May). The crown prince of nature writing, Robert Macfarlane, returns with &lt;em&gt;Underland: A Deep Time Journey&lt;/em&gt; (Hamish Hamilton, May), exploring the worlds beneath our feet. A watery world is navigated by Caroline Crampton, former &lt;em&gt;NS &lt;/em&gt;digital editor, in&lt;em&gt; The Way to the Sea&lt;/em&gt; (Granta, June), which investigates the human and natural histories of the Thames Estuary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;rtecenter&quot;&gt;
	****&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Publishing has been quick to embrace the #MeToo movement. The journalists who exposed Harvey Weinstein share their stories in &lt;em&gt;She Said&lt;/em&gt; by Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey (Bloomsbury, November) and &lt;em&gt;Catch and Kill&lt;/em&gt; by Ronan Farrow (Fleet), coming in the spring. When a group of women challenged the BBC over their gender pay gap, Carrie Gracie went one further and resigned as China editor, triggering a parliamentary inquiry. Her book &lt;em&gt;Equal&lt;/em&gt; is published by Virago in September. Meanwhile &lt;em&gt;Invisible Women&lt;/em&gt; by Caroline Criado Perez (Chatto &amp;amp; Windus, March) highlights the “gender data gap” – the hidden ways in which women are excluded from places of power – and &lt;em&gt;Women vs Capitalism&lt;/em&gt; by Vicky Pryce (Hurst, autumn) reveals the ways the market economy skews male.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The contemporary essay, by contrast, skews female: &lt;em&gt;Constellations&lt;/em&gt; by the Irish critic Sinéad Gleeson (Picador, April) deals with a body going through sickness, health and motherhood, while &lt;em&gt;Trick Mirror &lt;/em&gt;(Fourth Estate, August) is a collection from the terrific &lt;em&gt;New Yorker&lt;/em&gt; writer Jia Tolentino about “how hard it is to see ourselves clearly in a culture that revolves around the self”. Two titans, Toni Morrison (Chatto &amp;amp; Windus, February) and Arundhati Roy (Hamish Hamilton, June), also have volumes of essays out, covering gender, globalisation, freedom and race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Race is a growing concern again, in publishing as everywhere, and in 2019 writers are taking on the return of “race science” – through Angela Saini’s &lt;em&gt;Superior&lt;/em&gt; (Fourth Estate, May) and Jennifer Eberhardt’s &lt;em&gt;Biased &lt;/em&gt;(William Heinemann, April) – and examining 21st-century black identity, in books such as Jeffrey Boakye’s &lt;em&gt;Black, Listed&lt;/em&gt; (Dialogue Books, April) and Johny Pitts’s &lt;em&gt;Afropean&lt;/em&gt; (Allen Lane, June).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Memoirs can be adept at unlocking social issues. In &lt;em&gt;Some Kids I Taught And What They Taught Me &lt;/em&gt;(Picador, April) Kate Clanchy draws on 30 years of teaching to produce a “revelatory picture of school life”. The proliferation of medical memoirs continues apace, but perhaps the most intriguing is &lt;em&gt;Let Me Be Not Mad &lt;/em&gt;(Bodley Head, February), an account of a clinical neuropsychologist’s own descent into madness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Music memoirists are heading into “difficult second album” territory: both Brett Anderson of Suede and Moby of, well, Moby, are back with sequels to acclaimed autobiographies, &lt;em&gt;Afternoons with the Blinds Drawn&lt;/em&gt; (Little, Brown, October) and &lt;em&gt;Then it Fell Apart&lt;/em&gt; (Faber, June) respectively. The tragedy and triumph of Joy Division and New Order are approached from different angles: by the drummer (and now tank collector) Stephen Morris in &lt;em&gt;Record Play Pause&lt;/em&gt; (Constable, February) and by the guiding hand of Jon Savage, who has assembled an oral history entitled, appropriately grandly, &lt;em&gt;This Searing Light, the Sun and Everything Else&lt;/em&gt; (Faber &amp;amp; Faber, March). Before she made it as a musician (or &lt;em&gt;NS&lt;/em&gt; columnist), Tracey Thorn was a typical teenager in a “stultifying” 1970s commuter town: &lt;em&gt;Another Planet &lt;/em&gt;(Canongate, February) is a wise and witty memoir of suburbia and how to escape it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;rtecenter&quot;&gt;
	****&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Last November, the news that Margaret Atwood had written a sequel to &lt;em&gt;The Handmaid’s Tale&lt;/em&gt;, set 15 years after the first book, was met with a mix of excitement and trepidation. In September, when &lt;em&gt;The Testaments&lt;/em&gt; arrives (Chatto &amp;amp; Windus), we will find out who was right. Edging into speculative fiction alongside Atwood, Ian McEwan has set his new book &lt;em&gt;Machines Like Me&lt;/em&gt; (Jonathan Cape, April) in an alternative 1980s where AI has rapidly advanced, and striding boldly into fantasy, the Booker winner Marlon James returns with &lt;em&gt;Black Leopard, Red Wolf&lt;/em&gt; (Hamish Hamilton, February), the first in a trilogy drawing on African mythology. Colson Whitehead cleaves to historical truth in &lt;em&gt;The Nickel Boys &lt;/em&gt;(Fleet, August) his brutal tale of two boys sentenced to a reform school in Jim Crow-era Florida.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	John Le Carré turned 87 and Edna O’Brien 88 in 2018: they return with, respectively, &lt;em&gt;Agent Running in the Field &lt;/em&gt;(Viking, October) and &lt;em&gt;Girl&lt;/em&gt; (Faber &amp;amp; Faber, September), about the Boko Haram abduction of hundreds of schoolgirls. Also in September, Michel Houellebecq has &lt;em&gt;Serotonin&lt;/em&gt; (William Heinemann), about an impotent, depressed, middle-aged agricultural engineer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There’s a trio of Goldsmiths Prize-winning authors with new work in 2019: collect the set, with Kevin Barry’s &lt;em&gt;Night Boat to Tangier &lt;/em&gt;(Canongate, July), “drenched in sex, death and narcotics”; Nicola Barker’s typically disobedient novella &lt;em&gt;I Am Sovereign&lt;/em&gt; (William Heinemann, July); and the third instalment in Ali Smith’s Seasons quartet, &lt;em&gt;Spring&lt;/em&gt; (Hamish Hamilton, March).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Zadie Smith’s&lt;em&gt; Grand Union &lt;/em&gt;(Hamish Hamilton, October), her first short story collection, will be a treat, but at present everyone is talking about Kristen Roupenian. When Roupenian’s story “Cat Person” – a funny and chilling tale of a bad dating experience, published in the &lt;em&gt;New Yorker&lt;/em&gt; – went viral last year, it was a matter of days before publishers around the world got into bidding wars over the author’s debut collection. Comprising seven stories, &lt;em&gt;You Know You Want This&lt;/em&gt; (Jonathan Cape, February) follows “women grappling with desire, punishment, guilt and anger”. And, as HBO have bought the rights, it may well be coming to a streaming service near you too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;Publication dates may change&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	In September 2015, the US magazine the &lt;em&gt;Atlantic &lt;/em&gt;published a cover story provocatively entitled “The coddling of the American mind”. It was co-written by social psychologist Jonathan Haidt and civil liberties lawyer Greg Lukianoff, and in it they excoriated students and universities for “policing speech and punishing speakers”, warning that this imperilled not only young people’s intellectual independence but their mental health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Its impact was immediate: the article became one of the &lt;em&gt;Atlantic&lt;/em&gt; website’s five most-read ever and was referenced during a Q&amp;amp;A session by Barack Obama: “I don’t agree that students at colleges have to be coddled and protected from different points of view.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Haidt and Lukianoff were later inspired to write a book entitled – despite their reservations – &lt;em&gt;The Coddling of the American Mind: How Good Intentions and Bad Ideas Are Setting Up a Generation for Failure&lt;/em&gt;. “That was a title made up by the editors at the &lt;em&gt;Atlantic&lt;/em&gt; after the article was written. We didn’t like the title [an allusion to Allan Bloom’s 1987 anti-relativist polemic &lt;em&gt;The Closing of the American Mind&lt;/em&gt;] because it seems insulting to the very people we want to reach,” Haidt, 55, recalled when we met recently in central London.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	“But coddling literally means overprotection, so our thinking was the title is true in that the really big problems – especially mental health – are caused by two factors: massive overprotection that began in the 1980s and social media.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The phenomenon that Haidt describes is often labelled a “free speech crisis” (the British government’s Office for Students has been awarded the power to fine universities that “no-platform” speakers). But both its scale and intensity are easily overstated. Disinvitation attempts have increased in recent years but stood at just 36 in 2017 (of which 20 were successful) across 4,583 US colleges and universities. Is Donald Trump, who relentlessly delegitimises the media and denounces dissent against him as unpatriotic, not a far greater threat to free speech than “snowflake” students?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	“I would agree with that, there’s no question that Trump is the bigger problem,” said Haidt, who is professor of ethical leadership at New York University and describes himself as a centrist Democrat. “But this is one of the two major objections I get to my work: how can you be talking about universities when Trump is president? My answer is I love universities, it’s where I live, the fact that Trump is a bigger problem doesn’t mean we shouldn’t address other issues.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Haidt also acknowledged that the matter is not one of untrammelled free expression – no speaker has an inalienable right to a platform. “I almost never talk about free speech but the conditions necessary for a community of free inquiry. It doesn’t mean people can say whatever they want, it doesn’t mean we need Milo Yiannopoulos [the alt-right provocateur]. What we need is a community in which people feel free to say what they’re thinking and to question those who make statements.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	His argument echoes that of John Stuart Mill who wrote in &lt;em&gt;On Liberty &lt;/em&gt;(1859) that unless received wisdom is “vigorously and earnestly contested, it will, by most of those who receive it, be held in the manner of a prejudice”. As Haidt bluntly remarked: “I read &lt;em&gt;Mein Kampf &lt;/em&gt;in graduate school, I’m glad I did. I’m Jewish, I study extremism. I want my kids to read &lt;em&gt;Mein Kampf&lt;/em&gt;. It makes no sense to say we can’t give it a platform in a university.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Haidt’s previous book, &lt;em&gt;The Righteous Mind: Why Good People are Divided by Politics and Religion&lt;/em&gt; (2012), urged liberals to appeal more successfully to conservative notions of loyalty and authority, rather than simply equality and justice. He partly attributes Trump’s election to the rise of progressive identity politics. “Hillary Clinton’s opening advertisement had lots of people who were visibly members of identity groups, it had only one white male with a speaking part.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But does the election of Trump not validate students’ anxieties? The Obama-era illusion of a post-racial America has been banished. “In the Middle Ages they’d put leeches on and if the patient wasn’t getting well, they’d put more leeches on,” Haidt, who is polite but forceful, sardonically replied. “I don’t think the election of Trump proves that America is a racist country. We found out it’s a lot more racist than we realised, there are actual Nazis. I didn’t know that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Haidt is troubled by the remorseless polarisation of US politics (“Trump is both a reaction to and an exacerbator of it”). But, I retort, it was the era of bipartisanship that delivered the Iraq War and reckless financial deregulation. “I certainly agree that putting together antagonists or opposites within an institution that channels the disagreement in positive ways is a good thing. But when the political system changes from sport to hooliganism, once people think the end justifies the means, then we’re asking for disaster.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Haidt solemnly concluded: “I see nothing that gives me hope. However, I’m constantly reminded by my libertarian friends that people have often thought this way and they’ve always been wrong… I’m not looking at property in New Zealand, I’m not planning to move my kids to another country, but I am expecting things to get worse in the next few years.”&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--

    <title>2019 – the big questions: Will Brexit actually happen?</title>
    <link>https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2019/01/2019-big-questions-will-brexit-actually-happen</link>

	Unless MPs finally agree on an alternative to a no-deal Brexit, the UK may desperately plea for an Article 50 extension. &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-node-image field-type-image field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;noscript class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoints=&quot;300 768 1024&quot; data-adaptive-image-300-img=&quot;&amp;lt;img class=&amp;quot;adaptive-image&amp;quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&amp;quot;300&amp;quot; typeof=&amp;quot;foaf:Image&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/lead_image/public/Longreads_2019/01/2019_01_ralph_brexit.jpg?itok=Hdek4pZZ&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&quot; data-adaptive-image-768-img=&quot;&amp;lt;img class=&amp;quot;adaptive-image&amp;quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&amp;quot;768&amp;quot; typeof=&amp;quot;foaf:Image&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/lead_image/public/Longreads_2019/01/2019_01_ralph_brexit.jpg?itok=Hdek4pZZ&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&quot; data-adaptive-image-1024-img=&quot;&amp;lt;img class=&amp;quot;adaptive-image&amp;quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&amp;quot;1024&amp;quot; typeof=&amp;quot;foaf:Image&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/lead_image/public/Longreads_2019/01/2019_01_ralph_brexit.jpg?itok=Hdek4pZZ&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&quot; data-adaptive-image-max-img=&quot;&amp;lt;img class=&amp;quot;adaptive-image&amp;quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&amp;quot;max&amp;quot; typeof=&amp;quot;foaf:Image&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/lead_image/public/Longreads_2019/01/2019_01_ralph_brexit.jpg?itok=Hdek4pZZ&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&quot;&gt;&lt;img typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/Longreads_2019/01/2019_01_ralph_brexit.jpg?itok=J_7SH9M5&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;
	In the months following the 2016 EU referendum, only the most evangelical Remainers spoke of stopping Brexit. The UK’s departure from the European Union – an institution it had long viewed with ambivalence – was regarded as inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn – both “reluctant Remainers” – immediately accepted the Leave vote. MPs voted by 498 to 114 to grant May the power to trigger Article 50, which she did on 29 March 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But in the two years since, the possibility that Brexit could be stopped has progressively increased. The loss of the Conservatives’ majority at the 2017 election empowered Remain MPs to challenge an enfeebled Prime Minister and left May dependent on the hardline Democratic Unionist Party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Brexiteers had boasted that the UK held “the strongest cards” in the negotiation. The collision with reality was painful. While the UK side remained irretrievably divided, the EU maintained a united front and forced Britain to agree to pay a £39bn “divorce bill”, to guarantee European citizens’ rights, and to accept a “backstop” – indefinite UK membership of a customs union – to prevent a hard Irish border. In return, May received a platitudinous, legally non-binding, 26-page Draft Political Declaration on Britain and the EU’s future relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	May’s draft deal united Remainers and Leavers in a strange harmony. Both argued that the proposed model was inferior to the UK’s à la carte EU membership: opt-outs from the single currency and the borderless Schengen Zone, a £4.9bn budget rebate and full membership of the single market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Like the 2017 Conservative manifesto, May’s Brexit agreement succeeded in repelling support, rather than attracting it. On 10 December 2018, faced with the possibility of the largest government defeat in the House of Commons for more than a century, the Prime Minister postponed a vote she had insisted was essential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	May has invoked two scenarios should MPs continue to defy her: no deal, or no Brexit. But only one of these can be right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If parliament rejects May’s agreement, the UK will by law leave the EU with no deal at 11pm on 29 March – an outcome for which it is profoundly underprepared. Food and medical shortages could result (the Health Secretary, Matt Hancock, recently warned the cabinet of potential deaths) and Britain would likely endure an economic recession, having resorted to unpalatable World Trade Organisation rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Unsurprisingly, then, MPs are resolutely opposed to this outcome. Conservative backbenchers Nick Boles, Anna Soubry and Sarah Wollaston have pledged to resign the Tory whip should a no-deal Brexit become government policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But mere opposition to no deal is insufficient; the Commons must agree an alternative. In extremis, MPs could pass a motion of no confidence in the government, triggering a general election if a new administration cannot be formed within 14 days. This could be achieved with as few as seven Tory rebels. But very few, if any, Conservatives are willing to risk handing Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour the chance to enter government at a moment of national crisis. And there is no guarantee that a new election, which polls suggest would return another hung parliament, would break the Brexit deadlock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This precarious stalemate has pushed an increasing number of Conservative and Labour MPs to support a second referendum (or “People’s Vote”). “MPs will desperately want to hand the screaming, defecating, vomiting baby back to its parents – the electorate – and let them decide what to do with it,” predicted the novelist Robert Harris on Twitter in July 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But to advance through the Commons, such a proposition requires the support of the government. At present it lacks even the endorsement of the opposition. Labour fears the political blowback a second referendum could cause and Corbyn, a longtime Eurosceptic, has never shown enthusiasm for the idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Though May’s de facto deputy, David Lidington, and her chief of staff, Gavin Barwell, were reported by the&lt;em&gt; Sunday Times &lt;/em&gt;to have floated the policy in conversation with MPs, the Prime Minister has declared that another vote would do “irreparable damage to the integrity of our politics”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But it is not unthinkable that May – whose word now counts for little – or a new Conservative leader could yet embrace a European referendum on the expedient grounds that Harold Wilson and David Cameron did. The Prime Minister could advocate a choice between her deal or no-deal, in the expectation that parliament would add Remain as a third option. A second Brexit referendum would not, as some claim, be undemocratic, but it would intensify the UK’s Leave-Remain divide and further undermine parliamentary sovereignty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As an alternative, some champion the softest of Brexits – a Norway-style deal that would preserve single market membership. This would be a very British compromise. The UK would leave the EU and its political structures but retain current economic ties: &lt;em&gt;plus ça change&lt;/em&gt;. But May, who dislikes free movement, and Corbyn, who dislikes free markets, have consistently opposed this model. Should parliament resolve to be irresolute, the UK will most likely extend the Article 50 period (with the EU’s permission), rather than leave with no deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	After the 1975 Remain vote, Harold Wilson declared that “14 years of national argument are over”. Just six years later, Labour was advocating withdrawal from the European Economic Community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	History, as Wilson and Cameron should both have known, is never over. When (and if) the UK leaves the EU, a campaign for it to rejoin will begin immediately. Brexit may happen, but the Europe question will never be settled.&lt;/p&gt;

	In October 2019, Mario Draghi’s eight-year term as president of the European Central Bank (ECB) is due to end. He is in a race against time to avoid an unusual accolade for a central banker: never once to have raised interest rates during his tenure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In decades gone by, central bankers earned their spurs by their expert navigation of the ebb and flow of the business cycle. For Draghi, however, no such dexterity has been required. All he has done is cut rates – eight times, from 1.5 per cent to zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	He is far from alone. Mark Carney has been even less busy. In the 66 months that Carney has been governor of the Bank of England (BoE), the chore of adjusting interest rates has troubled him for only three – and the policy rate remains a mere quarter of a per cent above its lowest level in 300 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But the ECB and the BoE have nothing on the splendid lassitude of the Bank of Japan. Not only has its governor since 2013, Haruhiko Kuroda, never once raised rates; his predecessor Masaaki Shirakawa, whose term began in 2008, didn’t either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This is the striking truth of the world’s most advanced economies. While GDP growth, inflation and unemployment in have long since recovered to historically normal levels following the crisis of 2008, their financial systems remain mired in an unprecedented experiment – one that has paralysed monetary policy for a decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Recent turbulence on the world’s stock markets suggests that many investors fear the prospect of central bankers bringing this Great Monetary Experiment to a close. Yet perhaps no less problematic are the consequences of allowing it to continue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Modern monetary policymaking is based on the simple idea that by varying the policy rate (or “bank rate”), a central bank can influence demand, and in doing so, control the rate of inflation. Raise interest rates, and borrowing becomes more expensive throughout the economy, cooling growth and inflation. Cut interest rates, and borrowing gets cheaper – with the opposite effect. Toggle nimbly between the two, and a target rate of inflation – say, 2 per cent, as in the UK – can be hit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One important detail is that this effect is achieved not only directly, by adjusting the cost of borrowing, but also indirectly by making assets cheaper or more expensive. When the interest rate available from the central bank falls, other, higher-yielding assets become more attractive – so their prices get pushed up. When the policy rate rises, by contrast, alternative assets look relatively less alluring – so they are sold down, until their price falls enough to entice savers back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Because borrowing at any scale depends not just on cost but on collateral, this valuation effect of monetary policy constitutes a second important channel of its effectiveness. When interest rates fall, the value of capital assets used as collateral for loans – be they shares, intellectual property, or real estate – inflates. As a result, credit becomes not only cheaper to service, but easier to access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Few would dispute that the process of asset price inflation has taken place across most advanced economies as a result of the Great Monetary Experiment of the past decade. A glance at a graph of house prices or stock markets will establish that. And, insofar as it has been an integral part of central banks’ efforts to achieve their target rates of inflation, this has not been controversial. The problem is that asset price inflation has also had two major side-effects, whose social and political consequences are far less benign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;rtecenter&quot;&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;****&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The first is distributional. Central bankers view things from the Olympian perspective of the economy as a whole. From the perspective of a particular household, or a particular region, however, the question of who owns the assets that have gone up in value is very important indeed. If the Great Monetary Experiment has worked in part by inflating asset prices, then its impact on the distribution of wealth, as well as the stability of inflation, needs to be weighed in the balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	We are not talking about small change. It is important to grasp the size and speed of the inflation in asset prices that have benefited those fortunate enough to own them over the past decade, relative to what might have been accumulated through actually saving out of income.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Between April 2009 and April 2016, for example, the price of an average London house rose from around £245,000 to just over £461,000. For the lucky owners this amounted to a windfall of £216,000, or just under £31,000 a year. If, on the other hand, they had enjoyed the average London household disposable income over that period, and saved 5 per cent of it each year, they would have notched up £14,000 in total.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Great Monetary Experiment created a market in which owning a home was more than 15 times as lucrative as saving for one, delivering for homeowners a century’s worth of saving in just seven years – and all without the need to cut back on spending at all. This “miracle” is in one very important sense an illusion. For the economy as a whole, this huge revaluation of assets has created no new net wealth; it has only transferred it from one group to another. Just as there is a buyer and a seller in every transaction, so there is a loser for every winner when asset prices go up. The social and political dividing lines exaggerated by this once-in-a-generation step change in the distribution of wealth – between rich and poor, and between young and old – is, however, very real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The second major side effect of the Great Monetary Experiment is perhaps even more of a problem. The environment of very low interest rates poses a major challenge to the great institutional infrastructure of pensions and insurance on which the advanced economies are built. The blunt fact is these monuments of commercial civilisation are, as currently constructed, not sustainable when savings offer no returns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Old-age pensions provide a stark and simple example; 25 years ago, long-term UK government bonds delivered a yield of 9 per cent. So, £100,000 of pension savings generated an income of £9,000 a year with a minimal degree of risk. Today, those same government bonds yield 1.25 per cent. At this rate of interest, delivering £9,000 a year requires a pot of £720,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In theory, one solution is simply for everyone to save more. With smaller returns but bigger pots, future retirees could expect the same pension income in retirement. In reality, the scale of the increase in savings required is unrealistic for most households.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It will not have escaped the alert reader that in many cases, the two side-effects described above will have worked in opposite directions for a single household. The homeowner close to retirement when the crisis struck a decade ago has seen the value of their house rocket while the income earned on their savings has shrivelled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This brings us to the most insidious of the unintended consequences of the Great Monetary Experiment: what could be called, with only a little hyperbole, the re-feudalisation of the economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Last year, a study by the &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt; revealed an important new trend. Confronted with the combination of sky-high house prices and rock-bottom rates of return on savings, British households have been remortgaging their homes and spending, or passing on, the cash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Popular uses, the study reported, include paying school fees or providing children with a deposit for a house of their own. The policies of the Bank of England have created the Bank of Mum and Dad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The great economic project of the past 100 years – in a sense, the great project of democratic capitalism since at least the financial revolution of the 17th century – was to replace dynastic inheritance and charitable donation with entrepreneurship and the welfare state as the master mechanisms for the distribution of wealth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Great Monetary Experiment, it seems, is turning back the clock. Sudden huge changes in asset valuation have reinstated the family, rather than the state or the market, as the sorting hat of where one ends up in life. “An Englishman’s home is his castle,” the old saying goes, and in the neo-feudal economy of the early 21st century, it conveys a contemporary truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;rtecenter&quot;&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;****&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Do central bankers really have the power to transform modern economies into neo-feudal facsimiles of their former selves – and all by simply doing nothing? I am fairly sure that all the central bankers I know would laugh at the suggestion. Yet so pervasive is the influence of monetary policy in today’s ultra-financialised economies that I am not so sure. Either way, we may soon have a test of the hypothesis. One leading central bank has already awoken from its slumber, and is in the process of reversing the Great Monetary Experiment. It happens to be the most important one of all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With a vigorous new chairman, Jerome Powell, at its helm, the US Federal Reserve has raised interest rates nine times in the past three years – back to a level which, at 2.5 per cent, almost smacks of normality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Will everything now swing into reverse so that asset prices tank, yields rise, the traditional machinery of saving judders back to life, and panicked grandparents are left surveying the wreckage of their trashed balance sheets? Or will central banks lose their nerve in the face of powerful new vested interests?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	My money is on the latter outcome. After all, it took the Black Death to do for feudalism the first time round.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;
	In early December, the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, used a speech in Brussels to suggest that, contrary to conventional wisdom, Donald Trump was “building a new liberal order”. Reflecting on the career of the recently deceased George HW Bush, who oversaw the end of the Cold War, Pompeo suggested that this was “the type of leadership that President Trump is boldly reasserting” today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It took Trump less than a fortnight to make a mockery of Pompeo’s claims, and to plunge his administration into yet another foreign policy crisis. Without consulting his cabinet, or any of America’s allies, Trump announced via Twitter that he would withdraw the 2,000 US troops that had been deployed in Syria as part of the mission to tackle Islamic State. Trump’s rationale was clear. In his view, IS had been defeated. But this was not the opinion of key allies, from the UK to the Kurds – who have borne the brunt of the fighting for months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The announcement was news to the defence secretary, James Mattis, who resigned shortly afterwards. In direct contrast to Pompeo’s spin, Mattis’s resignation letter made clear that his belief in the vital importance of America’s “unique and comprehensive system of alliances and partnerships” was inconsistent with the president’s views. Thus departed the last of the so-called “adults in the room”, whose presence was supposed to keep Trump’s behaviour within certain bounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	At one level, we should not be surprised. If Trump believes anything, it is that America’s long-standing commitment to upholding international order has been too costly, allowing its allies an easy ride. He arrived in office promising to end misbegotten efforts at “nation-building in Afghanistan” and began by slashing US aid and shrinking the size of the diplomatic establishment. Despite the abrasive rhetoric that has poured from the White House in the past two years, there is little evidence that Trump desires a major war. Nevertheless, his penchant for drama, brinkmanship and confrontation – habits exacerbated by a growing siege mentality – continue to cause unease. Trump is not the sole aggravating factor, but in the vacuum of American leadership, a conflict between great powers seems more likely than it has for a generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;rtecenter&quot;&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;****&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In 2015, Graham Allison, the Douglas Dillon professor of government at Harvard’s Kennedy School, put forward the idea of a “Thucydides trap” in which an established power cannot help but see a rising power as a threat, leading inexorably to war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Allison’s historical model described the outbreak of the Peloponnesian War in the fifth century BC, but the Thucydides trap has become ubiquitous in discussions about 21st-century international affairs, from student common rooms to international summits. It is increasingly used as a cautionary tale for how the US should approach the rise of China, so that it can carefully navigate the minefield ahead. Yet the broader popularity of the Thucydides trap reflects a general sense that we are doomed to repeat the mistakes of history. It has been repurposed to cover potential geopolitical flashpoints ranging from the Sea of Azov, where Russia recently captured Ukrainian artillery boats, to the Strait of Hormuz, where Iranian threats to close the shipping lanes risk incurring the wrath of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Just as cool heads are needed, the fate of the West has been to fall victim to a series of domestic political convulsions – the time-lagged effects of the 2008 financial crisis – across Europe and the US, leaving very few nations unscathed. Under President Trump, whose anxiety about the rise of China is long-established, the prospects of a sophisticated diplomatic triangulation in Sino-American relations – a new “Nixon goes to China” – is highly implausible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	At the same time, however, blaming all the West’s woes on Trump risks becoming an act of displacement, belying a tendency in some European capitals to presume that the world will revert to its previous equilibrium once he leaves office. It is easy to be swept up in talk of a return to a “bipolar” world dominated by two superpowers, while failing to respond to more pressing challenges, from migration flows to increasing Russian aggression against Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The tension between Washington and Beijing is being called a “new Cold War”. And yet, at December’s G20 Summit in Buenos Aires, Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, toned down the rhetoric over the tit-for-tat tariff dispute of 2018. Trump delayed the threatened imposition of new 25 per cent tariffs on a range of Chinese imports, while Xi made some concessions on the trade imbalance (by committing to buy more American goods). In a strange echo of the Opium Wars of the 19th century, when Britain insisted on its right to trade poppy seeds despite it being banned by Chinese authorities, Beijing agreed to criminalise the export of fentanyl – an opioid that can be ordered online and which has become America’s most lethal drug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Trump does not want a war with China. He pays far more attention to the economic relationship than the broader strategic picture, and he is not particularly exercised on the most likely potential military flashpoint, in the South China Sea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	What he wants is to be able to claim credit for a “great deal” on trade by the time of the next presidential election in November 2020, and he remains convinced that he can get it when the Chinese are ready. So the wrestling with Xi will resume in 2019, with Trump’s overall aim being to get the Chinese to drop what he sees as unfair trade practices, including widespread intellectual property theft and potential government mining of data through firms such as telecoms giant Huawei (which in August last year was banned by Australia from supplying its 5G network due to fears over Chinese state interference).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Domestic political factors will also impose themselves on the president’s calculations. Some of the economic good weather for which he has taken credit, such as record stock market highs and employment rates, is beginning to pass, as the bounce from his tax cuts diminishes and growth projections fall. On the one hand, he is under mounting pressure from big business and the agricultural sector (where his base is strong) to end the disruption caused by the tariff war. If his own tariffs increase the living costs of middle-class Americans, this will become more serious. On the other hand, he will be anxious to preserve the support of the “Rust Belt” states that gave him victory in 2016 and which the Democrats are targeting. In these areas – where the “American carnage” of industrial decline, cited in Trump’s inauguration speech, has been so great – the tough line on China is at its most popular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But China is not the only offender in the president’s eyes. If his trade war becomes mutually harmful, he may turn to easier targets. Car imports are next on the agenda. Just as he did with steel and aluminium, Trump has ordered a national security investigation into America’s trade in foreign automobiles, which he believes is damaging domestic industry. A tariff hike on cars imported from Europe and Japan is being mooted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As the two behemoths square up, more medium-sized powers – including American allies – are likely to get caught in the crossfire. Canada is currently bearing the brunt of Chinese fury after Huawei’s chief finance officer, Meng Wanzhou, was arrested in Vancouver following a US extradition request, with a number of its citizens detained in China. The US initiated punitive measures against the tech firm over alleged breaches of sanctions, and Trump has hinted that Meng might be a bargaining chip in his trade negotiations with China, despite her being in Canadian custody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;rtecenter&quot;&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;****&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Second-guessing the president’s next foreign policy move is difficult because he can be two things at once: surprisingly pragmatic, in his increasingly desperate attempts to cling on to political power; and temperamental and erratic, when confronted with unwelcome surprises. In September last year, an anonymous senior official in the administration wrote an op-ed in the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; that revealed deep concerns about the commander-in-chief. “Meetings with him veer off topic and off the rails, he engages in repetitive rants, and his impulsiveness results in half-baked, ill-informed and occasionally reckless decisions that have to be walked back,” it claimed, suggesting there was an internal resistance within the administration to prevent the president from going wildly off course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This matches the picture painted in Bob Woodward’s book, &lt;em&gt;Fear: Trump in the White House&lt;/em&gt;, of an administration characterised by a “nervous breakdown of executive power”. In it, Woodward reveals the story of Trump’s wild reaction to news that Bashar al-Assad had launched another chemical attack on civilians in April 2017. “Let’s fucking kill him! Let’s go in. Let’s kill the fucking lot of them,” was the president’s reported response. On that occasion, it was Mattis who resisted Trump’s whim and circumvented the order. That check is now gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	At another meeting of the National Security Council, Trump is reported to have questioned the point of the large US military presence in the Korean Peninsula, including an early detection system for North Korean missile launches. He was rebuked by Mattis, who told him it was necessary to “prevent World War Three”. Another senior Republican, Senator Bob Corker, chairman of the Senate’s committee on foreign relations, has also expressed concern that Trump’s erratic behaviour would put the US “on the path to World War Three”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	And yet, when it comes to getting tough with China, there is probably more consensus between those inside and outside the administration than on nearly any other foreign policy issue. Ash Carter, formerly Barack Obama’s defence secretary, recently wrote a report that urged making Asia-Pacific the greatest geopolitical priority, by deepening relations with allies and better aligning military and economic strategy. Many of those who once hoped to incorporate China into the rules-based order have become latter-day China hawks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;media-image attr__typeof__foaf:Image img__fid__100838 img__view_mode__media_large attr__format__media_large&quot; height=&quot;532&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/2019_01_iran_usa.jpg?itok=4F3PBdhu&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Iranians protest after Trump pulls the US out of the JCPOA nuclear deal, May 2018&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	On other contentious issues such as American strategy towards Iran, there is not only more division but a greater prospect of military confrontation in the short term. Once again, it is worth reiterating that Trump is clearly allergic to any kind of major ground invasion. But – as seen twice in Syria – he is not averse to the symbolic use of US air power. And when it comes to Iran, he clearly relishes the idea of a showdown. In November, for example, he took to Twitter to announce that “sanctions are coming”, with a &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones &lt;/em&gt;meme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	So far, the effectiveness of those sanctions in squeezing the Iranian regime – and curtailing its activities in Syria and Yemen – is up for debate. To the irritation of some hardliners, the administration agreed a waiver that allowed several of Iran’s existing oil customers (including China), to continue some trading without sanction. This does not qualify as the “maximum pressure” advertised by John Bolton, the hawkish national security adviser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Having junked his predecessor’s policy on dealing with the Iranian nuclear threat, the multilateral Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), Trump will be eager to claim some success in 2019. One area of undoubted consistency in his foreign policy is the firming up of alliances with Iran’s foremost enemies. This applies particularly to Israel but also to Saudi Arabia, and explains why the latter has avoided major censure from Trump after the murder of &lt;em&gt;Washington Post &lt;/em&gt;columnist Jamal Khashoggi in October.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	And yet Trump’s unilateral decision to order the withdrawal from Syria has also thrown his administration’s Iran strategy into chaos. In September, Bolton claimed that American forces now had another mission. They would remain in Syria “as long as Iranian troops are outside Iranian borders, and that includes Iranian proxies and militias”. In one fell swoop, the president pulled the rug from under both Mattis and from Bolton – who had been eyeing a bigger prize than defeating IS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Iran’s footprint in Syria now includes the command of at least 10,000 proxy fighters, the supply of thousands of rockets to Hezbollah and – as revealed in the past few months – an attempt to build tunnels into Israel from which to launch attacks. The building of those tunnels has raised fears that a regional war is in the offing. It has become a major concern for hawks in the administration, such as Brian Hook, the top official on Iran, and those outside it, such as Senator Ted Cruz, who is trying to burnish his foreign policy credentials. Another potential flashpoint is the Strait of Hormuz, through which 20 per cent of the world’s oil and almost all of Qatar’s liquefied natural gas is shipped – and which Iran is threatening to close if there are further hostilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;rtecenter&quot;&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;****&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It has been claimed that there is an appetite within the Trump administration for American-led regime change in Iran; but this seems less likely than before. There is certainly no serious constituency for an attempt at democratic transformation, such as that associated with the catastrophe in Iraq in 2003. Nonetheless, the willingness to disturb and destabilise the Iranian government has led to a major shift in rhetoric from the “live and let live” rationale behind the 2015 JCPOA. In July last year, Pompeo gave a speech on “supporting Iranian voices” in which he reached out to those suffering at the hands of the regime, promising that the US stood in solidarity with them. One can expect more of this in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Insofar as Donald Trump’s foreign policy follows any pattern, it has been to engineer disputes, to claim victory on the basis of little of substance and then focus on something else. If the same calculus holds in 2019 – and if the wrestling with China fails to yield any tangible benefit – his appetite for a showdown with Tehran may increase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;
	Did you have a wonderful Christmas? Then for God’s sake don’t tell me about it. As it happens, I had a perfectly nice time here in London, helped by one sensible decision – I logged out of Instagram. Why? Because I had realised I was drowning in other people’s personal Nativity plays, as they performed Christmas cheer with the zeal of an out-of-work actor auditioning for a solid three-month run as Widow Twankey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Scrolling through my feed, there was the two year old, briefly dazzled by meeting Santa (not pictured: the rest of the day, when she cried continuously and refused all food and comfort). The smiling family posing with their roast dinner as if Dad had just popped to the next room (reality: Dad with new girlfriend). The heart-warming picture of a visit to Grandma (“shame that she’s an emotional terrorist”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In social media posts such as these, no one is lying, exactly. But they are curating their lives and repackaging them for public consumption, often at the expense of &lt;em&gt;living&lt;/em&gt; them in all their complexity. This was the Christmas when half a dozen of my friends confided that – whisper it – they felt like failures. They weren’t enjoying themselves as much as everyone else seemed to be. Luckily, thanks to the oldest kind of social media, talking, they discovered that they were not alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It says something profound (and unsettling) about modern life that we’ve turned “relaxing and having fun” into something it’s possible to flunk. When everything is measurable, the temptation is to stop doing stuff simply because you fancy it. Social media has created an age of envy, and it can feel exhausting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In 1977, Susan Sontag published an extraordinarily prescient book called &lt;em&gt;On Photography&lt;/em&gt;. She was writing at the dawn of truly mass photography, when cameras moved from being cumbersome machines to objects that could be carried in a single hand, or worn around the neck. That also transformed the nature of photography, she argued: “Photography is not practised by most people as an art. It is mainly a social rite, a defence against anxiety, and a tool of power… As that claustrophobic unit, the nuclear family, was being carved out of a much larger family aggregate, photography came along to memorialise, to restate symbolically, the imperilled continuity and vanishing extendedness of family life. Those ghostly traces, photographs, supply the token presence of the dispersed relatives. A family’s photograph album is generally about the extended family – and, often, is all that remains of it.” Taking pictures of your kids, meanwhile, was treated as evidence that you cared for them. The unphotographed child was a neglected child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Sontag’s words made me think again about all those Facebook and Instagram posts, and what I saw this time was something else: guilt. For many of us, seeing our families involves epic car journeys, complicated train rides or even long-haul flights. We can’t pop round for a cuppa, and the time and distance involved in reaching them places us in a perpetual state of low-level anxiety that we’re not making enough effort. Taking a blizzard of photographs feels like the least we can do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	These feelings must be incredibly common, but we don’t talk about them enough. Spending Christmas in London brings home the scale of internal migration Britain has experienced in the last few decades. The streets are empty, the shops are shut, you can even get a seat on the train. (You could, if you wanted, sprawl across three of them, like a guest at a Roman banquet.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The story of Jesus’s birth has extra resonance to twenty- and thirty-somethings in the capital, who all “return to their own town” in winter for a census of sorts, as their families appraise their lives in That London. (“You look tired!”, “Are you working too hard?”, “How you get on the Tube every day, with all those people, beats me”.) Many of the people here are really from somewhere else, and they make a yearly pilgrimage home to fix their parents’ WiFi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For many of my generation, Christmas has become a complicated negotiation across scattered families (“we were at his parents last year, so it’s mine this year; but we’ll go to his on the Friday and stay through to New Year so they don’t feel left out”) which leaves them more exhausted than before the holiday started. Many of my friends’ parents are retired, and yet are mysteriously resistant to travelling themselves. Others are divorced, leading some couples with young children to attempt something close to an assault course over 48 hours, alternating between driving and eating turkey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Yet too many Facebook pictures don’t show any of this stuff, life’s equivalent of the serene swan’s legs furiously paddling away underwater. Now, my family really is scattered – parents in one city, me another, two children in a different continent, another in Solihull. And photographs have brought us together: through the family WhatsApp group I can see my nephews and nieces growing up, tall and tanned in the Antipodean sun. I know that it rained on Christmas Day in Auckland. Thanks to FaceTime, I could almost feel the heat in Perth by seeing how my sister’s family was visibly wilting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But these are private moments, more likely to feature grumpy expressions or drizzle than toothy smiles and cloudless skies. Accordingly, sarcasm is allowed; sometimes we revel in taking deliberately crap photos, or capturing particularly awful moments (the tent collapsing, a temper tantrum, chocolate sauce gone everywhere). It’s life. There are no Likes to be had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	How was your Christmas? Mine wasn’t award-winning, or a day I’ll remember forever, but it was absolutely fine. And I’m absolutely fine with that.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--

    <title>First Thoughts: HMV’s inevitable decline, my predictions for 2019 and the curse of press vilification</title>
    <link>https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2019/01/first-thoughts-hmv-s-inevitable-decline-my-predictions-2019-and-curse-press</link>

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;
	The surprise is not that HMV has gone into administration but that, in the age of Amazon and Spotify, it has survived for so long. Yet its shops are rarely empty. The merit of high street stores is that you can wander into them and browse. Nearly all the laments for HMV recall the writer’s serendipitous discovery in one of its shops of some previously unknown artist. Now customers go home and order up what they’ve chosen, at the lowest possible cost, and preferably free, from the internet. Whether selling books, records or clothes, whether independents or chains, all the traditional high street names suffer in similar fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The internet behemoths are essentially parasites, leeching their news from newspapers and many of their sales from what Marxists might call actually existing shops. In a just world, governments would force them to pay appropriate fees. It is one of the great political failures of our time that nobody has found a way even to extract significant taxes from them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	The prediction game&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; columnist and Tory peer Daniel Finkelstein writes that his new year resolution is to remember at all times “that I don’t know what is about to happen”. When predicting the future, he promises, he will“provide a percentage probability of different outcomes”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Following this admirable lead, here are my predictions for 2019. A version of Theresa May’s Brexit deal will, after much wailing and gnashing of teeth, make it through the House of Commons. Probability: 89.684 per cent. May will still be PM and Tory leader this time next year: 92.592 per cent. John McDonnell will be Labour leader by the end of October: 43.333 recurring per cent. England will fail to win the World Cup in either cricket or rugby union: 78.927 per cent. Paul Dacre will return as &lt;em&gt;Daily Mail&lt;/em&gt; editor. 2.409 per cent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I arrived at these figures by using extensive data and a newly developed algorithm. No, of course not. I just invented them. But at least I look jolly clever and authoritative and nobody can accuse me of being wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	A migrant non-crisis&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	More than 220 refugees/migrants (delete according to political preference) have tried to cross the Channel in small boats since the beginning of November. On Christmas Day, 40 were found on Kent beaches or rescued from the sea. The Home Secretary Sajid Javid declares a “major incident” and scuttles home from safari in Africa. Hysterical Tory MPs take to the airwaves. Whether they are worried about dead bodies washing up on the south coast, or live bodies roaming the lanes of Kent, is hard to tell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In 2017, Turkey hosted 3.5 million refugees, Pakistan (from which Javid’s parents hailed) 1.4 million, Germany 970,400 and Lebanon 998,900 or one in six of its population. In 2015, 900,000 refugees/migrants arrived in Europe after crossing the Mediterranean by boat, 10,000 of them in Greece on one day. In 2018, Spain took nearly 60,000. Many of these desperate people are accommodated in squalid camps. As a compassionate country, we would regard that as an affront to human dignity. Or is the affront to our aesthetic sensibilities? As the exam questions say, discuss – with comparative references to rough sleepers on city streets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	The press drones on&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	After the pre-Christmas closure of Gatwick because of drones being flown over the airport, a couple from nearby Crawley were arrested. The &lt;em&gt;Mail on Sunday &lt;/em&gt;(and some other newspapers) named them and asked “Are these the morons who ruined Christmas?” The answer to questions in newspaper headlines is nearly always “no”. But most readers wouldn’t even register the question mark. The couple were released without charge shortly afterwards. Meanwhile, their personal details had been widely publicised and parents, former partners, employers and friends interviewed at length.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The couple, lawyers say, could sue as the retired English teacher Christopher Jefferies did successfully after he was arrested in 2010 for the murder of Joanna Yeates and falsely described as “a peeping Tom”. He too was released without charge. But why should people have to sue? Shouldn’t they be protected from this kind of press vilification – even more so if they are charged, since what amounts to character assassination prejudices their chances of a fair trial?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If such coverage were regulated, editors argue, it would infringe press freedom. But the freedom to call innocent people morons or peeping Toms is not worth preserving. The press should be free to publish names and photographs, which may prompt members of the public to come forward with evidence of guilt or innocence. It should, however, stick to simple facts and refrain from embellishing them with adjectives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	Memories of a mentor&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To the Savile Club in London for a celebration of the life of my former colleague Eric Clark, a formidable investigative journalist who died a few weeks before Christmas at 81. When I joined the &lt;em&gt;Observer &lt;/em&gt;in 1968, with no experience of journalism except on a student newspaper, Clark was given the task of training me. I now remember little of his instruction beyond the advice to use a stronger deodorant in the office but, without his kindly guidance, my journalistic career might not have lasted more than a few months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Years later, in his book &lt;em&gt;The Real Toy Story&lt;/em&gt;, he exposed the toy industry and how it deliberately turned toys into badges of status and stifled creative play. While researching, he asked me, by then &lt;em&gt;New Statesman &lt;/em&gt;editor, to grant him accreditation to attend a US reception held by the industry’s top people. I readily agreed. During the reception, a British executive walked up to Clark, peering at his lapel badge. “That’s funny,” he said. “In my country we’ve got a magazine of the same name. But they wouldn’t get in here. They’re all communists.” &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--

	Philip Pullman was nearly 50 when the first volume of the epic &lt;em&gt;His Dark Materials&lt;/em&gt; trilogy was published. In the saga, the newly knighted Sir Philip takes up William Blake’s reflection on &lt;em&gt;Paradise Lost&lt;/em&gt; – that Milton was “of the Devil’s party without knowing it” – by creating a world in which God is a dying tyrant, the afterlife is a prison camp, and true happiness comes from being reabsorbed into the fabric of the universe. The trilogy is spell-binding, thought-provoking and stylishly written, and has deservedly become a critical and commercial success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The honours system has frequently been degraded by the quality of its recipients (and it is hard to see, this year, why the right wing Conservative MP John Redwood merits special recognition). A knighthood for Philip Pullman, however, is richly deserved. Before achieving success as a writer he was a teacher, and continues to campaign for literacy today, opposing cuts to library services. Market fundamentalism, he warned in a speech in 2011, will “kill off every humane, life-enhancing, generous, imaginative and decent corner of our public life”. It is a point that our “Crumbling Britain” series has also made. Some things cannot be measured on balance sheets; books, and the magic inside them, are always worth defending.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--

    <title>Leader: A bad year for Brexit</title>
    <link>https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2019/01/leader-bad-year-brexit</link>

	If exiting the EU is an ill-conceived project, then 2019 is a particularly poor time to enact it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;111Leadersmalldropcap&quot;&gt;
	There has never been a good moment for Brexit. The United Kingdom, which sensibly avoided membership of the single currency, has long benefited from the economic prosperity and global influence that membership of the EU delivers. But if Brexit is an ill-conceived project then 2019 is a particularly poor time to enact it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;111Leadertextindent&quot;&gt;
	The US, with which Leavers boasted the UK would forge closer ties, is led by Donald Trump, the most reckless and disruptive president in postwar history. As Professor John Bew writes on page 20, the resignation on 20 December of former defence secretary James Mattis, who warned President Trump was undermining allies and empowering enemies, confirmed the administration’s grim trajectory. The US, which acted as the guarantor of the post-1945 international order, is performing what the historian Nigel Hamilton has called an “Amerexit”. Two of the traditional pillars of British foreign policy are crumbling simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;111Leadertextindent&quot;&gt;
	The 2016 Brexit vote did not result in the economic recession that some unwisely forecast (though it did turn the UK from the fastest-growing G7 country into the slowest one). But a mere three months before Britain’s scheduled departure from the EU on 29 March, the threat of a new crisis is rising. After nearly a decade of consistent, if sometimes anaemic, economic growth, both the UK and the world are overdue a new recession, one which a full-scale trade war between the US and China could yet precipitate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;111Leadertextindent&quot;&gt;
	Even before Brexit, an era of high debt and ultra-loose monetary policy meant the United Kingdom had little ammunition with which to confront a slowdown. The threat posed to economic relations with the EU – the UK’s largest trading partner – merely heightens the risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;111Leadertextindent&quot;&gt;
	In an unsightly attempt to bribe Conservative MPs into backing Theresa May’s Brexit deal, Downing Street has spent recent weeks doling out knighthoods and other state honours. But the Prime Minister still lacks the votes needed to pass her agreement. As numerous Brexiteers have conceded, Mrs May’s deal is far inferior to EU membership. In order to prevent a hard Irish border and preserve essential economic ties, the UK would sacrifice national sovereignty by becoming a rule-taker, rather than a rule-maker. The mistake is to suggest that this outcome was not inevitable. Britain was always destined to face an unpalatable choice between prioritising prosperity and prioritising sovereignty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;111Leadertextindent&quot;&gt;
	Faced with the likely defeat of Mrs May’s agreement in the Commons, some Leavers now openly advocate no-deal – a calamitous outcome for which the UK is unprepared. But there are alternatives to this chaotic fate. The extension of Article 50, to permit time for a new general election or a second referendum, must now be considered. Democracy did not end on 23 June 2016 and much has changed since then: Mr Trump is in the White House and the folly of Brexit has been exposed. Faced with this forbidding prospectus, it would be careless for the UK to relinquish the right to think again.&lt;span class=&quot;111Bullet&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:8.0pt&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt; &lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-b05865b9-7fff-48f5-f736-0239e769eee9&quot;&gt;One of the trademarks of Soviet generals was to order mass offensives by troops that did not exist. Famished and depleted brigades would be cajoled out of defensive positions, and made to run 50 yards into machine gun fire, in order to prevent their commander from getting court-martialed. The whole charade - beginning with the Spanish Civil War and reprised in 1941 - was, in its origin, political. Soviet communism had always to be seen as an attacking organism, never a defensive one.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-b05865b9-7fff-48f5-f736-0239e769eee9&quot;&gt;As the May administration spirals towards its end, Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson is beginning to sound a lot like one of those Soviet generals. With a defence budget 18 per cent smaller than it was in 2010, he has claimed that Britain is to launch a string of bases that will, after Brexit, make it a “true global player”.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-b05865b9-7fff-48f5-f736-0239e769eee9&quot;&gt;When a few refugees made it across the English Channel in ramshackle boats, evading the entire border security and naval apparatus of the “true global player”, the farcical nature of the claim was revealed. Britain does not even have the capability to police its own territorial waters. It is so far from being a “true global player” that – if we had a media capable of doing more than processing MoD press releases – Williamson’s claim would be laughed out of court.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-b05865b9-7fff-48f5-f736-0239e769eee9&quot;&gt;But the philosophy of “global reach” has its roots in the same post-imperial fantasy as hard Brexit. Like the Soviet policy of attacking with non-existent troops, it is based on a political conceit dating back to the early 20th century: that Britain, with 0.87 per cent of the world’s population, can meet defensive commitments close to its borders while policing the rest of the world at will. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-b05865b9-7fff-48f5-f736-0239e769eee9&quot;&gt;The modern policy of “global reach” was first outlined in David Cameron’s 2015 defence review: it committed the UK to a naval base in Bahrain, and envisaged a new expeditionary force of 50,000 personnel, capable of being deployed anywhere in the world.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-b05865b9-7fff-48f5-f736-0239e769eee9&quot;&gt;Cameron and George Osborne linked this vision overtly to their strategy of building trade links beyond Europe. There was the same vague assumption that lay behind Hillary Clinton’s “pivot” to Asia: that the rules-based trading order would need to be underpinned by a Western military presence close to India and China. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-b05865b9-7fff-48f5-f736-0239e769eee9&quot;&gt;In the end, the entire premise of the 2015 defence review has been exploded. The urgent threat remains jihadi terrorism. But the most important and strategic threat is Russia’s hybrid warfare operation against Western democracies. This could have been foreseen in 2015. But nobody foresaw that Putin would be gifted a plaything in the White House, dedicated to ripping up the multilateral, rules-based order and unleashing a trade war with China, while conducting unaccounted briefings with Putin himself and attacking the US’s own intelligence services.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-b05865b9-7fff-48f5-f736-0239e769eee9&quot;&gt;Britain, sitting at the Western end of a continent riddled with social conflicts, which is being targeted by Putin’s hybrid warfare machine, needs a defence strategy and capability to meet this threat. Nothing in the 2015 document, and too little in Williamson’s cut-down review, entitled the &lt;em&gt;Modernising Defence Programme&lt;/em&gt; and published last month, truly addresses this.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-b05865b9-7fff-48f5-f736-0239e769eee9&quot;&gt;Instead, thanks to a combination of conservative cant, inter-service buffoonery and woeful illiteracy among MPs, we have the fantasy of “global reach”. All this with a navy comprised of just 19 big ships; an army which cannot fill its 8,200 manpower gap without employing migrants; barracks unfit to live in and a £15bn gap between procurement plans and the actual budget.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-b05865b9-7fff-48f5-f736-0239e769eee9&quot;&gt;Right now, we have a battlegroup of 800 troops in Estonia, with tanks and armoured vehicles, plus another 130 operating under US command in Poland. But the real threat to our security is developing behind this frontline. It is developing in Budapest, where the Nato-member government is bought to the hilt by Russia. And in Austria, where the far-right/conservative coalition is pro-Putin. And in the far-right and right-wing populist movements across Europe, all of which are being manipulated by Russia, to fragment both NATO and the EU.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-b05865b9-7fff-48f5-f736-0239e769eee9&quot;&gt;In his December statement, Williamson told MPs that “NATO is stronger and the UK is a leader”. Neither is true. NATO’s mutual defence commitment is becoming dangerously undeliverable. Vast swathes of civil society in Europe would not support any kind of military standoff with Russia, especially if preceded by a chaos-inducing hybrid warfare campaign, mobilising organised crime, propaganda outlets, high finance, corrupt politicians and the money of the American alt-right.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-b05865b9-7fff-48f5-f736-0239e769eee9&quot;&gt;An added problem is the incoherence of Britain’s opposition parties. The SNP wants to leave the UK and abolish the nuclear deterrent. Labour’s shadow defence secretary Nia Griffith, though strong in her critique of underspending by the Tory-led MoD, and in her commitment to the deterrent, lacks the political backing to make the case for a clear alternative defence strategy. So I will make it here. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-b05865b9-7fff-48f5-f736-0239e769eee9&quot;&gt;Britain needs a defence posture focused on meeting the primary military threat: a mixture of cyber-warfare, assassinations, organised crime, propaganda and financial manipulation that is designed to render its underpowered conventional defence capabilities useless. We don’t want, or need, to fight Vladimir Putin: we simply need to deter his attempts to weaken our democracy; show leadership to a Europe full of tin-pot crooks; and redesign our armed forces in a way best adapted to meeting this threat, in this period, in this potential theatre of operations, which ranges roughly from Iceland to Alexandria.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-b05865b9-7fff-48f5-f736-0239e769eee9&quot;&gt;This means overtly disavowing a strategy of global reach. Symbolic frigates and infantry battalions scattered across the territories of the old British empire may comfort golf club Tories, and pander to service traditions, but they are strategically worthless. The argument that, owing to globalisation, Britain’s security begins in the Singapore Strait is worth addressing: but one Type 26 frigate patrolling there is equal to no frigates at all. If you defend everywhere you defend nowhere.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-b05865b9-7fff-48f5-f736-0239e769eee9&quot;&gt;Britain should concentrate its armed and security forces on the two tangible threats to the security of its citizens and to the stability of its democracy: jihadi terrorism and Russian hybrid warfare. We are well-equipped with intelligence and security forces to meet both threats. The Dreadnought-class submarine programme will ensure the essentially political nuclear deterrent is maintained. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-b05865b9-7fff-48f5-f736-0239e769eee9&quot;&gt;But the conventional forces in between are too weak and their structure badly-designed. They are underfunded and insufficiently rooted in civil society. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-b05865b9-7fff-48f5-f736-0239e769eee9&quot;&gt;This, in turn, has consequences for the nuclear deterrent. Some argue the current naval and air assets surrounding it are too small to protect it. Others that the weakness and unsuitability of our conventional forces make us dangerously over-reliant on nuclear deterrence. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-b05865b9-7fff-48f5-f736-0239e769eee9&quot;&gt;Even if we increase defence spending to 3 per cent of GDP, the pressures of keeping a nuclear deterrent going would require hard choices about conventional forces.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-b05865b9-7fff-48f5-f736-0239e769eee9&quot;&gt;In the 2015 defence review Cameron’s government designed a force structure for an unspecified future expeditionary war. I want British military thinking to disavow expeditionary wars of the type fought in the Falklands, Afghanistan and Iraq, and concentrate on defending Europe. But the forces Cameron’s government envisaged can be adapted to this new task. The UK will have a deployable force of around 50,000 personnel with lighter and modernised armour, a lot of hi-tech weaponry, a big special forces capability and an aircraft carrier with a lot of F35 multirole fighters.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-b05865b9-7fff-48f5-f736-0239e769eee9&quot;&gt;The question - and it is a political question - is where this force should be deployed and trained to fight - and where it should not. The main British military force should be focused on Europe and the North Atlantic. Not just in its equipment and training, but in its ethos. Since Iraq and Afghanistan, an entire generation of military leaders in Britain have grown up with a small wars culture: counter-insurgency, infantry patrols, special forces, language expertise in Arabic and Pashtun. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-b05865b9-7fff-48f5-f736-0239e769eee9&quot;&gt;That, in turn, cascades over into civil society’s image of what a war is: heavily-armed British infantry patrolling villages in the dust. Sadly, this is about as far removed from the conflicts we will face in the 21st century as the Boer War was from D-Day. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-b05865b9-7fff-48f5-f736-0239e769eee9&quot;&gt;The conflict we are engaged in is one where a semi-dictatorship intends to pollute our public discourse, destroy our democracy, flood our society with organised crime and buy its way into our institutions. Then, as it takes chunks of territory out of its neighbouring states, and reduces NATO to a talking shop, the rule-based geopolitical system gives way to one based on great power rivalry. At this point we had better hope that the other Western countries with serious armies are still democracies. But that is not a given.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-b05865b9-7fff-48f5-f736-0239e769eee9&quot;&gt;Meeting Britain’s security challenges requires politicians to begin speaking straight language, not the risible waffle Williamson is prone to. Here’s how I would put it: we face a new threat but it is containable if we meet it calmly and maintain a credible deterrent force, both at the nuclear and conventional level. Our military needs significantly more money and support; in turn, its internal culture must become more reflective of the real Britain and we have to ask more of our young people to serve in the armed forces, either as regulars or reserves. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-b05865b9-7fff-48f5-f736-0239e769eee9&quot;&gt;And we are going to need the political capability to design strategy. Despite the creation of a National Security Council, we lack a cross-party community of politicians, experts, academics and military capable of having an informed debate.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-b05865b9-7fff-48f5-f736-0239e769eee9&quot;&gt;But having that conversation honestly means ceasing the Soviet-style bravado of the current administration. We cannot and should not be a “true global power”: we should be a major regional player in the defence of Europe against destabilisation and of our own society against terrorism. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-b05865b9-7fff-48f5-f736-0239e769eee9&quot;&gt;Global reach was always a fantasy - with the same nostalgic origins as hard Brexit. As one evaporates, so should the other.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--

    <title>Is The Favourite historically accurate in its depiction of Queen Anne’s lesbianism?</title>

	Yorgos Lanthimos’ new movie, &lt;em&gt;The Favourite&lt;/em&gt;, opens in the UK on New Year’s Day, having already swept up major international awards and enjoyed the biggest success at the US box office of any recent British independent film. Its story, set in England during the first decade of the 1700s, is of how Sarah Churchill, 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; Duchess of Marlborough (played by Rachel Weisz) was usurped as the royal favourite of Queen Anne (Olivia Colman) by her lowly cousin Abigail (Emma Stone). The movie is no “straight” historical costume drama, however. It has been highly fictionalised throughout, in Lanthimos’ distinctively eccentric style. This does not mean that the film wears its history lightly, nor that it lacks ambitions to convey certain larger biographical truths. Indeed, where exactly it does and does not choose to stick to historical fact is particularly intriguing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One of the film’s more subtly feminist ideas is, maybe ironically, the way that the leading ladies’ physical bodies are emphasised. Queen Anne has no fixed image in our national consciousness, but now – given the movie’s many scenes of Anne in a wheelchair, hobbling along palace corridors in a deranged state, or with poultices being applied to her painful limbs – it is unlikely that anyone will think of her without thinking of her semi-invalidism. At the time, the royal doctors considered Anne to be suffering from gout, severe myopia and the blighted womb of a “&lt;em&gt;mater infelix&lt;/em&gt;” that seemed incapable of giving the nation a living heir. Modern medics now suspect her to have been suffering from a type of lupus (&lt;em&gt;erythematosus&lt;/em&gt;), which can cause chronic arthritis, repeated miscarriages, red skin rashes, and joint pain in hands and legs. This probable lupus was compounded by obesity in later life, a symptom more of her enforced immobility than of her appetite. Even at her coronation, Anne had to be carried in a sedan chair, which rather undercut the allusions that the text of the ceremony made to her as another great warrior queen like Elizabeth I.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Anne was also, probably, suffering from depression triggered by repeated bereavements: by the age of 16 she had lost her mother, a favourite governess and six siblings; in 1688, she had been forced to abandon her father James II because of his Catholicism; and between 1685 and 1700, she suffered the unimaginable loss of 17 pregnancies, stillborn babies, infants and children – all under circumstances of intense public scrutiny. After her last surviving and much adored child, Prince William Duke of Gloucester, died aged 11 from complications related to hydrocephalus, Anne always signed herself to Sarah as “your poor unfortunate faithful Morley” – Mrs Morley being one of their intimate nicknames – and she became even more emotionally dependent on Sarah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Which brings us to the next focus of physicality: the question of what evidence there is for Anne’s lesbianism. The film does not hesitate to show Anne repeatedly consummating sexual desires for both Sarah and Abigail; indeed, it contains the second most memorable on-screen British royal cunnilingus scene of 2018-19 (first prize going to the new Mary Queen of Scots film). On the one hand, there is no historical evidence for such carnal pleasures having been enjoyed, but on the other there is no way to rule them out categorically and that is the beauty of a fictionalisation. Lesbian love affairs leave notoriously fewer traces – such as illegitimate bastard children – on the historical bedsheets, and arguments along the line of “But she was happily married!” are beside the point. What exists in terms of hard archival evidence are Anne’s hundreds of adoring letters to Sarah, and reports that a succession of people close to Anne – her father, her sister and others – discouraged her “unnatural” attachments to Sarah and other ladies, starting with a governess named Mrs Cornwallis and ending, after Abigail, with the red-headed Duchess of Somerset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The 1670s Restoration Court, in which Princess Anne and Sarah had come of age, had been a place where intense, monogamistic, gender-bending relationships, and their attendant jealousies and betrayals, were the fashion among many of the young ladies, and Anne’s formative adolescent years in this atmosphere seem to have permanently shaped her psyche. A long line of biographers and historians have been eager to discount the double meanings of words such as “inclination” and “passion”, about which the young women were obviously self-aware. Ever since they were girls, they had played in the dangerous borderland between platonic and erotic love and, as a new generation of writers such as Valerie Traub and Emma Donoghue have argued, early modern lesbianism was effectively hidden in plain view by such language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In all probability, Anne, who was far more pious and prudish than Sarah (Anne prayed several times a day and once objected to the amount of shoulder showing in her portrait on a coin) would not have admitted such homoerotic desires to herself, let alone acted on them. But that does not make this interpretation of her latent feelings, with the benefit of modern hindsight, fanciful or inappropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Sarah, meanwhile, was probably playing a more cynical but understandable game: the only game, perhaps, that she could afford to play when faced with a besotted and insistent royal employer. Certainly, she was well aware of how her thinly veiled accusation that Anne and Abigail were lovers, with Anne having “no inclination for any but her own sex”, could raise questions about her own previous relationship with the Queen; indeed, it was this knowing self-implication that gave Sarah’s insinuations their unique power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	After being displaced by Abigail, Sarah wrote to Anne on several occasions to inform her of scandalous publications that accused the Queen of sleeping with her chambermaid. What made Sarah’s claims of concern for Anne’s reputation particularly dubious was the fact that Sarah herself had helped produce at least one of them. It was only the disapproval of Sarah’s husband, John, which put a stop to such letters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The third striking episode of physicality in the film is the attempt by Abigail to murder Sarah, which leaves the Duchess wearing a pirate’s eye patch. This is an entirely imagined interlude, yet it carries within it several symbolic truths about the Marlboroughs’ fall from power, which Sarah herself dramatised as a tragedy in her own memoirs, finally published in 1744. Even the eye patch is a kind of visible gauge of Sarah’s power being eclipsed and the darker side of her personality, her indignation and her temper, rising in response. This symbol of her glory being eclipsed could have been even stronger if the film-makers had dared to turn Weisz blonde to play a woman who was famous for washing her golden hair in honey water and was described by another besotted young female admirer as a beauty “with rays about her head like a sun”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Beyond its genre and gender defying physicality, the film is also of the &lt;em&gt;#MeToo&lt;/em&gt; zeitgeist in terms of starring three actresses who interact in equally strong, central roles, with the male courtiers relegated to the side-lines or merely manipulated (metaphorically or lewdly) by the women. None of the female characters is presented as a fully edifying feminist – or queer – heroine, however, and that is perhaps one of the expectations most daringly subverted by the script. In this nuanced complexity of characterisation, the film is realistic. In terms of how far all three women – particularly Sarah – were able to act independently of the men around them, and express themselves within early eighteenth century politics, it is less so. As Sarah herself put it in later life, perhaps with some bitterness:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
		“In the late Queen’s time, though I was a favourite, without the help of the Duke of Marlborough and Lord Godolphin [Anne’s Lord Treasurer] I should not have been able to do anything of consequence, and the things that are worth naming will ever [only] be done from the influence of men.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Sarah was too hard on herself. Her political influence was far-reaching, even if she could not always control the Queen’s Council directly. And it was largely Sarah’s outspoken opinions which would shape posterity’s views of Anne, and the incoming Hanoverians’ views of the Tory party, for the remainder of the century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Favourite&lt;em&gt; is in UK cinemas from 1 January 2019. Ophelia Field is the author of &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Favourite-Churchill-History-Behind-Picture/dp/1474605354/ref=as_li_ss_tl?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1542986299&amp;amp;sr=1-1&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=orionma-21&amp;amp;linkId=5c52b340500afa5b155f81eed83a73d7&amp;amp;language=en_GB&quot;&gt;The Favourite: Sarah Duchess of Marlborough&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; (W&amp;amp;N, 2018 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; edition, £9.99)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>There’s something everyone has missed about polls and the People’s Vote</title>

	This poll showing Labour members back a People’s Vote is big news, but not for the reason you think.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-node-image field-type-image field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;noscript class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoints=&quot;300 768 1024&quot; data-adaptive-image-300-img=&quot;&amp;lt;img class=&amp;quot;adaptive-image&amp;quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&amp;quot;300&amp;quot; typeof=&amp;quot;foaf:Image&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2019/01/gettyimages-939591040.jpg?itok=4lnn7qIb&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&quot; data-adaptive-image-768-img=&quot;&amp;lt;img class=&amp;quot;adaptive-image&amp;quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&amp;quot;768&amp;quot; typeof=&amp;quot;foaf:Image&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2019/01/gettyimages-939591040.jpg?itok=4lnn7qIb&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&quot; data-adaptive-image-1024-img=&quot;&amp;lt;img class=&amp;quot;adaptive-image&amp;quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&amp;quot;1024&amp;quot; typeof=&amp;quot;foaf:Image&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2019/01/gettyimages-939591040.jpg?itok=4lnn7qIb&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&quot; data-adaptive-image-max-img=&quot;&amp;lt;img class=&amp;quot;adaptive-image&amp;quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&amp;quot;max&amp;quot; typeof=&amp;quot;foaf:Image&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2019/01/gettyimages-939591040.jpg?itok=4lnn7qIb&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&quot;&gt;&lt;img typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2019/01/gettyimages-939591040.jpg?itok=4lnn7qIb&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;
	A survey of Labour Party members has confirmed what we already know: that most Labour activists want another European referendum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	That confirms what we’d expect, given what we know about the demographics of party membership &lt;em&gt;regardless &lt;/em&gt;of party: which is that it tends to be better educated than the country as a whole, and that the more qualifications you have, the more likely you are to have voted Remain in 2016. Labour members also score highly for social liberalism, which in combination with a larger preponderance of qualifications means that we would expect Labour members to be supportive of the idea. It also broadly echoes polling conducted by the People’s Vote campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In a way, it doesn’t matter, as the Labour Party’s policy position is now set, and no amount of opinion polls of the party membership will change that (who despite their pro-Europeanism have consistently opted to give Jeremy Corbyn a great deal of latitude to set Brexit policy as he sees fit). But it does tell us something very useful.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The big and important difference is that this is polling conducted by the Economic and Social Research Council’s party members project, a three-year programme of academic research into who party members are and what motivates them. Their brief isn’t to advance a political argument but simply to find out more about the people who join political parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	That’s particularly important as far as this question goes, precisely because it slightly changes the question they’ve asked. The People’s Vote campaign has tended to use deliberately loaded questions in order to get the most favourable response. That’s why a People’s Vote poll&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ft.com/content/dc56ee36-bea4-11e8-95b1-d36dfef1b89a&quot;&gt; by YouGov&lt;/a&gt; in September 2018 found that 86 per cent of Labour members want another referendum. In contrast, the ERSC poll (also by YouGov) found that 72 per cent want another referendum, still a large number but obviously quite a bit smaller than that found by the People’s Vote campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Why does that matter? Well, because elections &lt;em&gt;aren’t &lt;/em&gt;ever conducted in the spirit in which academics commission polls, or pollsters themselves conduct their voting intention surveys (which, remember, don’t make them very much money and exist solely as a prestige part of the brand to pull in lucrative work from a supermarket or whatever). No pollster would ever think that commissioning a poll saying “would you rather stay in the EU or spend £350m extra a week?” would be a good way of getting an honest answer to that particular question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But it’s the job of campaign groups to try to do something similar in real life to what the People’s Vote campaign is doing with its polls. As it stands, at the next election, the Conservative Party will want the question voters are asking when they vote to be “is Jeremy Corbyn a strong leader?” while Labour will want the question to be “is the British economy working for people like you?”. Neither of those questions is a neutral “how will you vote at the next election?” type question, which is part of why voting intention surveys can often give us the wrong results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It’s still not clear what the question that the Remain side will want the next referendum to be about. We know that the ballot paper will be something like “accept the deal/stay in the European Union” and that any Leave campaign will want the question to be “should politicians tell you what to do?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The form of words that the People’s Vote campaign use to gin up support for another vote is a useful campaigning technique to &lt;em&gt;get &lt;/em&gt;another referendum – but it isn’t the same as having a message to win it. We can also say with certainty that while the People’s Vote will try to make as many people believe that the question is the one they are putting in &lt;em&gt;their &lt;/em&gt;polls, Brexiteers will want a loaded question of their own: and the media and cultural advantages that Leave had in 2016 are still alive and kicking in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It should worry Remainers that even among such a pro-Remain electorate as the Labour Party membership, switching from a pro-People’s Vote frame even to a neutral one shaves 14 points off their support. The resumption of political hostilities in the event of an actual referendum might yet end up with a more emphatic version of the answer the United Kingdom arrived at in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;Note: Pollster Peter Kellner had thoughts on this argument. You can read his response &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/staggers/2019/01/are-people-s-vote-polls-loaded-no-says-peter-kellner&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;
	The end of the year is always a chance to look back and reflect on people you have met over the past months. In my role as shadow justice minister, I have a lot to be thankful for. I’ve been lucky enough to work with a range of people with an interest in the law – from lawyers who have supported me with policy development, to victims who have bravely spoken out so we can demand action from the government, to charities who are tirelessly working to stem the tide of negative consequences from the government’s disastrous record of cuts to everything from policing to prisons to legal aid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But this new year I will be thinking of one incredible young woman in particular, who reminds me just how much there is to do to make sure that those responsible for our justice system look like the country they serve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Earlier this year I met 18 year old Bryony Toon, a care leaver who receives free school meals at Quarrydale School in my former coalfields constituency. She was part of the Sutton Trust’s excellent Pathways scheme, designed to support young people from disadvantaged backgrounds to access the professions.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Despite Bryony’s difficult start in life, she has a monumental drive to succeed. After her post-16 advisor suggested she use her sharp mind, outstanding grades and “strengths in arguing” to explore a career in the law, she set out to seize every opportunity available. She landed work experience at top law firm Clifford Chance, and applied for Oxford University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This was certainly a smart move. The statistics show your chances of doing almost any job at the top of the legal sector are significantly enhanced if you come from a wealthy background – one thing Bryony cannot achieve through hard work alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Sutton Trust say that 71 per cent of top QCs, 74 per cent of judges and 51 per cent of partners in top law firms had attended an independent school – an astonishing state of affairs given that just seven per cent of children are educated privately. Even amongst less elite legal roles like solicitors, a whopping 27 per cent go to private school, according to figures from the Law Society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Bryony can certainly try to get herself some elite credentials by applying for Oxford. After all, three quarters of judges, and 80 per cent of top QCs went to Oxbridge, so it’s virtually a pre-requisite. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But it seems that it just isn’t that easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	She had an interview at Brasenose College earlier this month, and diligently prepared for every possible question she could be asked. But when it came down to it, no amount of preparation could change the fact that she &lt;em&gt;just didn’t feel she belonged&lt;/em&gt;. She was left feeling totally out of place after meeting other candidates and students who seemed to be from a different world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	“I felt massively marginalised and left out from ‘posh’ people,” she said. “Even if I get an offer, I’m now not sure Oxford is for me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This month I also spoke to some other amazing young women from non-traditional backgrounds, who are further along in their career journey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Deeba Syed, Chair of Young Labour Lawyers, told me, “There is a culture of white middle-class etiquette. Our Christmas party is a black-tie event – I’ve never been to a black-tie event before. If you are talking about your life and reveal you’re from a different social strata, I think it can affect your performance and happiness.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Another, who grew up on a council estate on free school meals, found she couldn’t get an interview, even after years of rigorous and expensive training. Feeling thoroughly demoralised, she decided to change her “Muslim-sounding” surname on the application – only to find responses from law firms rolling in. She is now a qualified solicitor, but is still angry that her background was “definitely to my detriment.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	We are now entering 2019. How can it be possible that talented young women are having to conceal their names and their backgrounds, to pursue a career in something as fundamental to our social fabric as the justice system? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Being in court is traumatic enough without being represented and judged by a cast of professionals from lawyers to justices who might as well come from a different planet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Our legal system must start to look like the country it serves. Until there is true diversity at every stage of the pipeline to the top, some of our best and brightest will continue to feel that law is not for ‘people like them’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Some great work is already underway, like the Sutton Trust scheme Bryony is benefitting from, and from top firms like Clifford Chance who have introduced name-blind applications, significantly increasing the numbers of non-traditional applicants they accept. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But it is clear that we have a long way to go. The Sutton Trust find it hard to provide opportunities outside London, and local firms outside London are some of the worst offenders for unpaid internships. We need to see more transparency from law firms at every level about who they are accepting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Inns that house the next generation of barristers are all in London. Couldn’t they establish regional centres, to draw on the full talent of the country, rather than requiring young people to leave their homes and head for the alien and expensive capital? They urgently need to expand their scholarship and bursary programmes and increase their diversity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Oxford are taking some steps to improve access for less privileged students – Bryony took advantage of their Law Faculty scheme to give state school students a taste of what studying law is like. But the cultural barriers she faces are just enormous, and her experience at interview has made her question if this is the right place for her, even if she is accepted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I have no doubt that Bryony will achieve her dream of becoming a human rights lawyer – her sheer determination and talent mean that the sky is the limit for her. But it is impossible to ignore the fact that Bryony’s background will make her a very rare breed at the top of the legal profession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I want everyone working at every level of the legal sector to make it their new year’s resolution to find more people like Bryony, do everything they can to nurture their talents, and create a climate where everyone feels welcome – so that we have a truly representative justice system. &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;
	“A revolutionary moment in history is a time for revolutions not for patching”. These are the words of the great 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century reformer, and founder of the modern welfare state, Sir William Beveridge. Belatedly, progressive political parties seem to be embracing the fact that the financial crisis of 2007-8 was just such a moment – and that there may still be an opportunity to seize it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	More than a decade on, our economy is still not working for the majority in our country; with anaemic economic growth as a result of low productivity and investment; precarious and low wage employment that is exacerbating inequalities; and an unstable and rent-seeking financial system that fuels asset price inflation but fails to support the real economy. No system can maintain itself for long in the presence of such obvious and pervasive flaws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There is a growing recognition, particularly in the Labour Party, but even in more mainstream political circles, that we need a paradigm shift in the way we think about both the state and the economy. However, the question which has remained unanswered for so long has been what this shift should look like in practice. As the philosopher Antonio Gramsci said, a “crisis consists precisely in the fact that the old is dying and the new cannot be born”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Fortunately, like solid land emerging from the mist after a long and dangerous voyage, a new manifesto for change is beginning to take shape. What is required, the IPPR argues, is investment-led growth. This would be delivered through active industrial strategy; the suppression of both speculative finance and monopoly power by greater regulation; and more equality, driven by higher taxes on wealth. In other words, a more active state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Progressive political parties are proving to be increasingly receptive to these ideas. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, described the IPPR’s Commission on Economic Justice as a “Beveridge Report for the 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century”. This description is apt, not only because it rightly recognises the importance of the CEJ’s findings, but also because it will require an effort equivalent to that which followed the original Beveridge Report to implement its recommendations. Put simply, we need a “1945 moment” to deliver prosperity and justice for all in the 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But, with Brexit, those of us wanting a bold transformation of our society, face a challenging paradox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	On the one hand Brexit is a sign that people want change. The vote to leave was not just – or even primarily – about the EU. It was a demand for a domestic political project that can close the gap between the lives people expected to lead, and the reality as they now experience it. The scale of this challenge is such that only a radical progressive political project can address such concerns. And the stakes couldn’t be higher. Failure to deliver reform could well unleash further outbreaks of populist anger and push people into the outstretched arms of xenophobic alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	On the other hand, however, Brexit is also inclined to make it infinitely harder to affect lasting change. This is partly because the constitutional wrangle around it leaves such limited political leeway for domestic policy. But, in truth, this lack of headroom is symptomatic of that far greater problem: profound social division. This is the real challenge facing progressives. Because it is these divisions that will make obtaining a sustained mandate for reform – and creating a politics stable enough to deliver on it – almost impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As the only successful paradigm shift in a progressive direction in modern British history, 1945 may seem like the model for a future progressive government. But in truth the lessons are cautionary rather than optimistic. After all, the achievements of the Attlee government were built entirely on the social consensus created by the Second World War. This experience engendered not only an understanding, across the classes, of their shared interests – and therefore the need to spread the benefits of economic growth more fairly – but it also vindicated the means by which this progressive agenda was to be delivered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As a result, all political parties went into the 1945 election supporting Keynesian demand management, as well as the adoption of the main components of Beveridge. In fact, much of the preparatory work required to deliver on this reform agenda – on education, unemployment insurance, the NHS and full employment – had been prepared by the coalition government of 1940-5. This meant that when the Labour Party took power, after the war, the bulk of its work – both in making the case for and starting to implement radical change – was done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	By contrast, our society today is hopelessly polarised. The divisions in our country – between people in metropolitan and rural areas; between those with education and those without; between the old and the young – were given expression in the Brexit vote. But they have also been exacerbated by it. The referendum split families, friends and neighbours and unleashed violence online and, at times, on our streets. As a result, the circumstances today for progressives could not be more remote from those of the Attlee government in 1945.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Therefore, the brutal truth is, unless a progressive political project can unite a majority in the country behind a bold reform agenda – not just win a majority in parliament – we will fail to transform the country. This is not to argue that delivering change is futile: on the contrary, the state of the country requires that it becomes a reality. But it should serve as a warning to those of who want a more economically and socially just society: that on each and every issue – including on a potential second referendum on Brexit – we must ask, “Will this bring our country together or push it further apart?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

    <title>“What is this thing called SAD?” Why we are still sceptical about the winter blues</title>
    <link>https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2019/01/what-thing-called-sad-why-we-are-still-sceptical-about-winter-blues</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-subheadline field-type-text-long field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;
	Despite the science behind Seasonal Affective Disorder, winter can seem all too convenient an explanation. &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-node-image field-type-image field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;noscript class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoints=&quot;300 768 1024&quot; data-adaptive-image-300-img=&quot;&amp;lt;img class=&amp;quot;adaptive-image&amp;quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&amp;quot;300&amp;quot; typeof=&amp;quot;foaf:Image&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/lead_image/public/Longreads_2018/12/gettyimages-55905772.jpg?itok=u4ZQo4Fg&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&quot; data-adaptive-image-768-img=&quot;&amp;lt;img class=&amp;quot;adaptive-image&amp;quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&amp;quot;768&amp;quot; typeof=&amp;quot;foaf:Image&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/lead_image/public/Longreads_2018/12/gettyimages-55905772.jpg?itok=u4ZQo4Fg&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&quot; data-adaptive-image-1024-img=&quot;&amp;lt;img class=&amp;quot;adaptive-image&amp;quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&amp;quot;1024&amp;quot; typeof=&amp;quot;foaf:Image&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/lead_image/public/Longreads_2018/12/gettyimages-55905772.jpg?itok=u4ZQo4Fg&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&quot; data-adaptive-image-max-img=&quot;&amp;lt;img class=&amp;quot;adaptive-image&amp;quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&amp;quot;max&amp;quot; typeof=&amp;quot;foaf:Image&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/lead_image/public/Longreads_2018/12/gettyimages-55905772.jpg?itok=u4ZQo4Fg&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&quot;&gt;&lt;img typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/Longreads_2018/12/gettyimages-55905772.jpg?itok=lq7H-6D3&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;
	It begins halfway through October. A sudden inner disintegration, like a sinkhole in the road. Then an emptiness, carefully fenced off with cups of tea and cinema trips. By November, you get up in the darkness, go home in the darkness. There are weeks without sun. You are on the verge of crumbling. In December, drunken crowds fill the streets, but you don’t know what they’re singing about. Being cheery is an act, a monologue you have to perform again and again to your co-workers at the Christmas party, your friends, your housemates. And it’s so dark. There is no road any more, just the sinkhole where the tarmac used to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	What I’m describing might sound like a mild version of Seasonal Affective Disorder, or the aptly-named SAD. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/seasonal-affective-disorder-sad/&quot;&gt;The NHS recognises it as a type of seasonal depression&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/seasonal-affective-disorder-1-in-3-people-suffer-from-sad-9814164.html&quot;&gt;according to one YouGov poll&lt;/a&gt;, as much as a third of Brits display symptoms of it. Alternatively, it might just be a description of winter. A 2016 study published in the &lt;em&gt;Clinical Psychological Science&lt;/em&gt; journal cast doubt over the connection between light deprivation and symptoms of depression. &lt;a href=&quot;https://health.spectator.co.uk/sad-news-for-those-who-suffer-from-sad-the-condition-is-probably-a-myth/&quot;&gt;Responding in the &lt;em&gt;Spectator&lt;/em&gt;, Julie Burchill wrote&lt;/a&gt;: “In my opinion, people who have SAD aren’t sick but rather simply sad that they’re not living some lotus-eating life in the sunshine, and don’t want to admit it as people might tell them to get over it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	SAD was first described in medical terms by Norman E. Rosenthal, a South African doctor &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/05/health/05brody.html?pagewanted=all&quot;&gt;who had noticed his own seasonal change in mood after moving to the United States&lt;/a&gt;. “When the days became short and dark I personally experienced a draining away of energy,” he told a Wellcome Trust panel in 2013. His wife, meanwhile, was “bedridden”. In 1984, he and a group of researchers &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6581756&quot;&gt;published a study&lt;/a&gt; describing 29 patients suffering from a depression that “seemed to respond to changes in climate and latitude”. The study also found that treating patients with bright artificial light had an antidepressant effect. By 1987, SAD had entered the &lt;em&gt;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, &lt;/em&gt;aka “the psychiatrist’s bible”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In the following decades, SAD blazed into public consciousness. In some ways, it had always been there. “In the northern part of Sweden there’s a condition called lappsjuka, which means the sickness of the Lapps, which is essentially SAD,” Rosenthal told the Wellcome panel. “In the folk literature of Iceland they have a term called skamdegistunglindi, which means the depression of the short days. So it’s there in the cultural writings, if not in medical literature.” But now, theories for the causes emerged, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/long_reads/dark-sad-mental-health-scandinavia-winter-norway-science-rjukan-biology-a7622241.html&quot;&gt;many focusing on the idea that the body clock falls out of sync with the time of day in the depths of winter&lt;/a&gt;. In 2018 alone, there were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30022319&quot;&gt;publications tracking a group of patients over 20 years&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924977X18301640&quot;&gt;monitoring seasonal levels of “the happy chemical”, serotonin&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.psypost.org/2018/11/genome-wide-association-study-identifies-gene-linked-to-seasonal-affective-disorder-52438&quot;&gt;the identification of a particular gene&lt;/a&gt;, all of which point towards a scientific basis for the winter blues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Sales of SAD lamps – a form of light therapy – have ignited. “The first stirrings are in late August, ” Jonathan Cridland, the chief executive of Lumie, a light therapy supplier whose clients include the NHS, says about the sales patterns. “It still feels like summer but people are coming back from holiday, school is due to start and the days aren’t quite as long as they were.” Lumie’s sales surge over the Christmas period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But at a time of enlightenment about mental health, SAD has also attracted a level of scepticism. “What is this thing called SAD?” demanded a 2008 academic paper by three Norwegian researchers. “The scientific community in psychiatry in Tromsø was rather taken aback by the SAD concept, and the claim that prevalence increased with latitude of living,” the paper continued. The researchers reviewed data on self-reported depression for the northern Norwegian city, a higher latitude than any major US city, including Alaska’s Anchorage, and found no correlation between the symptoms and the amount of light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The researchers also compared Norwegian and Russian communities on the same latitude, and found much higher rates of depression in the latter, poorer, population. &lt;a href=&quot;https://today.oregonstate.edu/archives/2013/aug/winter-depression-not-common-many-think-osu-research-shows&quot;&gt;A 2013 study by researchers at Oregon State University&lt;/a&gt;, meanwhile, did not dispute the existence of SAD, but suggested “what we often think of as the winter blues does not affect people nearly as much as we may think”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	SAD may be a modern-day example of a medical myth, suggests Steven LoBello, one of the authors named &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/2167702615615867&quot;&gt;in the 2016 study&lt;/a&gt;, which analysed data from more than 34,000 US respondents and found no correlation between latitude and symptoms of depression. He tells me how, &lt;a href=&quot;https://pabook.libraries.psu.edu/literary-cultural-heritage-map-pa/feature-articles/philadelphia-under-siege-yellow-fever-1793&quot;&gt;in 1793, the city of Philadelphia was gripped by a Yellow Fever epidemic&lt;/a&gt;. At first residents blamed it on the autumn, then on the putrid bale of rotting coffee sailors had dumped in the docks. The true cause, mosquitoes transmitting the disease, was not discovered until 1881. “It was a big, dramatic change in the environment that everyone could see and smell,” LoBello says, of the rotting coffee bale. As for the link between depression and light: “When the seasons change, I think a lot of things change.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Take someone who loves to exercise outdoors. In the summer, they can play football in the park after work, and even squeeze in a run home before the sun sets. By December, the same park is muddy, the football team may have taken a winter break, and the running route feels too dangerous when unlit at night. It’s not hard to imagine that same person feeling frustrated, unfulfilled – and freezing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Similarly, LoBello argues, it is hard to measure the impact of light therapy, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/seasonal-affective-disorder-sad/treatment/&quot;&gt;which usually takes the form of sitting in front of a SAD lamp for 30 minutes to an hour a day&lt;/a&gt;, without controlling for a placebo effect. “There is more than one thing going on there,” he says. “A person is exposed to the light, but they are also slowing themselves down, they are quietening themselves. Maybe they are doing something enjoyable like reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	“No one has said ‘yes, they are looking at the light, but they are also taking time for themselves.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While writing this article, I asked many friends and acquaintances whether SAD existed. Some felt the question was borderline offensive; others thought SAD sufferers should “harden up”. While everyone took depression seriously, there was a suspicion that real SAD patients were outnumbered by SAD pretenders, who saw an opportunity to medicalise their grumpiness, rather than take responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It is possible to detect some sexism in this enduring disbelief. Many studies find women are more likely to be affected – and we already know that when women report other issues, like pain, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/women-and-pain-disparities-in-experience-and-treatment-2017100912562&quot;&gt;they are serially undertreated&lt;/a&gt;. “You’d expect that there are studies that won’t agree – that’s part of science,” Stephany Biello, professor of neuroscience and biopsychology at the University of Glasgow, tells me. “But the weight of the majority of evidence is that SAD is a real thing. It is a kind of depression and it is on a spectrum.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Still, I do have some sympathy with the sceptics. I have felt some version of that sudden, inner disintegration every winter, at least since the age of 13, and perhaps even younger. I do not understand people who say the season “makes them feel cosy”. I have never got excited about a Pumpkin Spice Latte. If I won the lottery, I would immediately buy a winter home in Spain. I have, without any official medical diagnosis, occasionally speculated that I have SAD, and no one has challenged me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But it is also true that I like being outdoors, and fingers that are not numb, and yet it took me 26 years to acquire sheepskin gloves and even longer to get winter running gear. I am a pessimist, even in the long, light days of summer, and as a journalist, I crave explanations. It is easier to blame winter. I have no doubt that sitting in front of a SAD lamp for 30 minutes a day would make me a better-balanced person, but that might also be down to the fact that my leisure time is one, long, endless to-do list that I have largely created for myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There are also, after all, beautiful things about winter. The sceptical researchers in Tromsø described a city in darkness for two months, but also a place where “there are fascinating changes from darkness to dim light”, and the Aurora fills the sky. The American winters that got Rosenthal so down took place on the same latitude as the Mediterranean – no doubt dark compared to South Africa, but with daylight hours Brits would envy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Typical winter days in Scotland, where I return home at Christmas, are nasty, brutish and short. But one winter, 2010, it snowed and snowed. Life slowed down, because it had to. My mother towed her briefcase in a sledge to work. The mid-morning sunrises and tea-break sunsets crept like a blush over Edinburgh’s marble-white parks. It was a difficult winter for me, the winter I lost my grandfather and wrestled with a dissertation, but I still remember the hush of the snow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Maybe, rather than trying to change people’s minds about SAD, we should change how we think about winter. Extend lunch breaks, so workers can see the sun. Cut relatives who disappear to Tunisia at Christmas a bit of slack. Spend more money on central heating. Celebrate all the festivals that fall in the darkest months of the year, as we should anyway in this diverse and dreich country. Get better street lights. Leave worrying about placebos to professional researchers, and just do what works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One thing everyone involved in the SAD debate agrees on: we don’t have to resign ourselves to the winter blues. Steve Hayes founded Lumie, the light therapy shop, in 1991, after recognising the symptoms of SAD in himself. He wooed his girlfriend with gifts of SAD lamps. It worked – he married her, eventually sold the business, and they moved to the south of France. “It is bright sunshine streaming through the window right now,” he says to me over the phone on a grey London day in mid-December. “That’s a bit better than a SAD lamp.”&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--

    <title>After a lucky escape in 2018, South Africa faces another year of political uncertainty</title>

	Cyril Ramaphosa, who replaced Jacob Zuma, has promised an election in 2019. &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-node-image field-type-image field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;noscript class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoints=&quot;300 768 1024&quot; data-adaptive-image-300-img=&quot;&amp;lt;img class=&amp;quot;adaptive-image&amp;quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&amp;quot;300&amp;quot; typeof=&amp;quot;foaf:Image&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2018/12/gettyimages-918610900.jpg?itok=zCRB9wsj&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;Cyril Ramaphosa&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&quot; data-adaptive-image-768-img=&quot;&amp;lt;img class=&amp;quot;adaptive-image&amp;quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&amp;quot;768&amp;quot; typeof=&amp;quot;foaf:Image&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2018/12/gettyimages-918610900.jpg?itok=zCRB9wsj&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;Cyril Ramaphosa&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&quot; data-adaptive-image-1024-img=&quot;&amp;lt;img class=&amp;quot;adaptive-image&amp;quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&amp;quot;1024&amp;quot; typeof=&amp;quot;foaf:Image&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2018/12/gettyimages-918610900.jpg?itok=zCRB9wsj&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;Cyril Ramaphosa&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&quot; data-adaptive-image-max-img=&quot;&amp;lt;img class=&amp;quot;adaptive-image&amp;quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&amp;quot;max&amp;quot; typeof=&amp;quot;foaf:Image&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2018/12/gettyimages-918610900.jpg?itok=zCRB9wsj&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;Cyril Ramaphosa&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&quot;&gt;&lt;img typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2018/12/gettyimages-918610900.jpg?itok=zCRB9wsj&quot; alt=&quot;Cyril Ramaphosa&quot; /&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;
	Like a stagecoach in an old Western, South Africa tottered on the edge of a precipice before being dragged back – but only just. The election of Cyril Ramaphosa as leader of the African National Congress just over a year ago was by the narrowest of margins. He defeated his rival, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, former wife of President Zuma, by 2,440 votes to 2,261. There was an almost audible sigh of relief. Dr Dlamini-Zuma was widely regarded as being a proxy for her one-time husband; a shield against the hundreds of charges of corruption against him, which are still to be heard in court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It is difficult to convey just how close to the edge the country came. An agreement struck between President Zuma and Russia’s Vladimir Putin in 2014 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ft.com/content/ce7d0fdc-2a7d-11e7-bc4b-5528796fe35c&quot;&gt;would have seen eight nuclear power plants built at a cost of one trillion Rand&lt;/a&gt;, ($76bn). It was a sum that the country could not afford. So desperate was Zuma to force the deal through that he sacrificed one minister after another, as each looked at the cost and refused to give it their approval. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-45245121&quot;&gt;What took place is now the subject of a Commission of Inquiry&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	President Ramaphosa has called elections for next year. They will be held before the end of May, &lt;a href=&quot;http://[https://www.thesouthafrican.com/south-african-elections-2019-voting-dates/&quot;&gt;although the exact date has still to be announced&lt;/a&gt;. At present the prospects for the ruling ANC look pretty good. &lt;a href=&quot;https://citizen.co.za/news/south-africa/politics/2047993/irr-poll-shows-anc-support-at-56-da-and-eff-down/&quot;&gt;The latest polling suggests they would receive more than half of the votes (56 per cent)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The main opposition party – the Democratic Alliance, which has faced internal strife, would get 18 per cent, while the radical Economic Freedom Fighters would win 11 per cent. The EFF leadership has recently been badly tarnished by the same accusations that it once flung at the ANC – &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iol.co.za/news/opinion/shades-of-brazil-as-anti-corruption-drive-in-south-africa-turns-nasty-18440264&quot;&gt;rampant corruption&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Perhaps the most interesting recent finding is how much dissatisfaction there is with the politicians. &lt;a href=&quot;http://afrobarometer.org/publications/south-africa-summary-results-2018&quot;&gt;More than half (53 per cent) of South Africans say they do not feel close to any political party&lt;/a&gt;. A majority of these “non-partisans” live in urban areas, are under the age of 35, and have a secondary or tertiary education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This is hardly surprising: the young face a life of unemployment and poverty. The unemployment rate among young people aged 15–34 &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.statssa.gov.za/?p=11129&quot;&gt;officially stands at 38.2 per cent&lt;/a&gt;. Unofficial estimates are even higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There is a seething anger among the young – some of whom have turned to racism. Andile Mngxitama, leader of Black First Land First publicly threatened to murder five white people for every black person killed. “You kill one of us, we will kill five of you. We will kill their children, we will kill their women, we will kill anything that we find on our way,&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.timeslive.co.za/news/south-africa/2018-12-10-complaints-pour-in-over-andile-mngxitamas-kill-whites-speech/&quot;&gt;Mngxitama said&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One of the key issues that Ramaphosa faces ahead of the election is what to do about the question of land. Just to recap: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natives_Land_Act,_1913&quot;&gt;in 1913&lt;/a&gt;, whites restricted black Africans from holding any more than a tiny fraction of the country. They were pushed back into “reserves” on just 13 per cent of the land. Under apartheid there were further seizures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The ANC government has – since 1994 – done much to settle urban land claims, and some black farmers have benefited from redistribution. But many schemes have failed and there is now a clamour for more radical measures: expropriation without compensation. Yet achieving this successfully seems close to impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For a start, the South African state lacks the means of achieving it. “Land reform in its totality is a strong, long-term positive for South Africa if it can be executed through a capable, capacitated and clean state — conditions that do not exist and are unlikely to do so in the foreseeable future,” &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businesslive.co.za/fm/features/2018-11-22-how-sas-politicians-broke-land-reform/?platform=hootsuite&quot;&gt;said Intellidex’s head of research, Peter Attard Montalto&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There is also fierce resistance to radical land reform from the Zulu King, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-safrica-land-zulus/zulu-king-wants-south-africa-land-reform-to-exclude-his-territories-idUSKCN1MI0SC&quot;&gt;who has warned of civil war if the vast land-holdings that he controls in KwaZulu-Natal are touched&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There is the further question of how to redistribute the land without crippling agricultural output. South Africa’s farms are among the most sophisticated in the world, producing crops on which people rely and which are critical to the country’s exports. Handing them over to small scale, peasant farming would hardly be a step forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	How Cyril Ramaphosa deals with this critical issue, and what role it plays in the election, could be important to its outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Uncertainty hangs over the election. South Africans, just like voters around the world, are increasingly sceptical about the political class as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Once they were willing to give Nelson Mandela and his party their undying affection. That has long since evaporated. There is an air of cynicism and dissatisfaction as South Africans head off to do what they do best: take a long rest over the Christmas break and speculate about what lies ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;
	On the arts pages of the &lt;em&gt;New Statesman&lt;/em&gt; this year, you’ll have found dreams of alien life and yellow submarines, and nightmares, of nuclear wars and the terrifying handshake from a bright orange man. Here’s a selection of the best writing on TV and film found in the magazine and website this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/2018/06/yellow-submarine-film-50-years-the-beatles-sixties&quot;&gt;50 years on, &lt;em&gt;Yellow Submarine &lt;/em&gt;tells the story of the Sixties&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Yellow Submarine began life late in 1967 as not much more than a contractual obligation. The Beatles had little interest in the making of it, and they barely appear in the movie. But, the movie says far more about them and the decade that they helped to define than they could ever have predicted, writes D. J. Taylor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/film/2018/03/here-come-bombs-making-threads-nuclear-war-film-shocked-generation&quot;&gt;Here come the bombs: the making of &lt;em&gt;Threads&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	“I wanted to show the full horror. I felt that was absolutely my responsibility.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In 1984, inspired by the leaked “Protect and Survive” films, a BBC team set out to create a relentlessly accurate vision of an atomic bomb landing on Sheffield. Jude Rogers on the nuclear war film that shocked a generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/film/2018/02/why-are-film-makers-obsessed-story-doomed-british-sailor-donald-crowhurst&quot;&gt;Why are film-makers obsessed with the story of doomed British sailor Donald Crowhurst?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Businessman and sailor Donald Crowhurst set out from Teignmouth, Devon, on 31 October 1968, as the last of nine competitors to enter the &lt;em&gt;Sunday Times&lt;/em&gt; Golden Globe race for solo, non-stop circumnavigation. He never returned. Jonathan Coe looked at two new films which explored the mystery this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/health/2018/06/love-island-why-niall-left-anxiety-stress-reality-tv-mental-health&quot;&gt;Anxiety on &lt;em&gt;Love Island&lt;/em&gt;: when reality TV stars have mental health problems&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Appearing on high-profile reality TV shows can be great for your profile, but terrible for your own image of yourself, and with social media comes a barrage of abuse. So are we putting people at risk for the sake of entertainment, asks Anoosh Chakelian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/tv-radio/2018/01/how-call-midwife-smuggled-radical-social-issues-britains-living-rooms&quot;&gt;How &lt;em&gt;Call the Midwife &lt;/em&gt;smuggled radical social issues into Britain’s living rooms&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The stories of the midwives and nuns of Nonnatus House have topped the ratings chart since they were first broadcast in 2012, regularly attracting more than ten million viewers a week. To put that another way: one in six people in the United Kingdom watch the show. Erica Wagner wrote about why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/tv-radio/2018/09/paul-hollywood-handshake-GBBO-Great-British-Bake-Off-horrifying-display-masculine-insecurity&quot;&gt;Paul Hollywood’s handshake is a horrifying display of masculine insecurity&lt;/a&gt;         &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Over the years, Hollywood’s handshake has morphed from a random quirk barely worth comment into the holy grail of validation, a golden ticket to&lt;em&gt; Bake Off &lt;/em&gt;greatness. And Anoosh Chakelian hates it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/tv-radio/2018/02/this-country-bbc-daisy-charlie-cooper-season-two-interview&quot;&gt;“We write about everyone that pissed us off”: siblings Daisy and Charlie Cooper on their hit hometown comedy &lt;em&gt;This Country&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The brother-sister duo behind the revolutionary BBC comedy told Anna Leszkiewicz about their childhood feuds, “the Mr Perkins scandal” – and stalking Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen in Cirencester.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/2018/10/22-july-Anders-Breivik-norway-netflix-review&quot;&gt;Living in the shadow of Breivik&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In Paul Greengrass’s new film, the Anders Breivik trial becomes a metaphor for how today&#039;s far-right is using and undermining the rule of law: Paul Mason on why &lt;em&gt;22 July&lt;/em&gt; could be the anti-fascist movie of our times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/tv-radio/2018/07/league-gentlemen-interview-tour-2018&quot;&gt;Laughing in the dark&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	20 years ago “four northern lads” brought their blackly comic vision of small-town life to our screens: this year, they returned, to expose the shadowy heart of England. Kate Mossman meets &lt;em&gt;The League of Gentlemen&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/film/2018/04/death-wish-and-beyond-bloody-history-vigilante-movies&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Death Wish&lt;/em&gt; and beyond&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The typical movie vigilante shares traits with the Trump voter: a white, middle-aged, middle-class male who regards himself as endangered. Ryan Gilbey re-tells the bloody history of vigilante movies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/2018/07/war-of-the-worlds-2018-bbc-hg-wells&quot;&gt;What &lt;em&gt;The War of the Worlds &lt;/em&gt;means now&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The myth is about to resurface yet again, in a BBC adaptation which the screenwriter Peter Harness describes as “a collision of sci-fi, period drama and horror”. But, finds Philip Ball, the Victorian anxieties that underlie HG Wells’s masterpiece have never gone away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/film/2018/02/lady-bird-editing-cinematography-memory&quot;&gt;“There is a vividness in worlds coming to an end”: on &lt;em&gt;Lady Bird&lt;/em&gt;’s aesthetic of memory&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	At a glance, the structure of Greta Gerwig’s coming-of-age film is deeply traditional, covering a single academic year. But the way time rushes forward is a theme of the film, finds Anna Leszkiewicz.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt; &lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	The cornerstone of the &lt;em&gt;New Statesman&lt;/em&gt;’s coverage of social issues in 2018 was our crumbling Britain series, which focuses on the impact that a decade of austerity has had on the services and infrastructure that the UK’s citizens rely on. Another key focus was the shambolic rollout of Universal Credit, creating problems for thousands of people trying to get by. Here are some of our best pieces from the year.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2018/04/crumbling-britain-thousands-my-elderly-aunt-suffer-public-realm-decays&quot;&gt;Crumbling Britain: Thousands like my elderly aunt suffer as the public realm decays&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	In April, our editor Jason Cowley kicked off our crumbling Britain series with a personal look at the experience of his aunt living in Harlow in Essex. Her local GP surgery was closed down after being taken over by a private GP practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2018/10/having-younger-partner-crime-universal-credit-couple-penalty-punishes-pensioners&quot;&gt;“Having a younger partner is a crime”: Universal Credit “couple penalty” hits pensioners&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	Over the course of this year, it became clear that Universal Credit was severely affecting people in ways the government had failed to consider. One such example was flagged to us by a reader, who told Anoosh Chakelian how couples with one partner under pension age could lose up to £100 a week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2018/11/do-academics-need-pseudonyms-protect-their-freedom&quot;&gt;Do academics need pseudonyms to protect their freedom?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	In November, a trio of academics announced they were setting up new journal in which articles would be published anonymously to protect authors from trenchant and sometimes aggressive criticism. The thinking behind the Journal of Controversial Ideas was that academia was no longer a safe space for those who wanted to handle ideas deemed beyond the pale by supposedly censorious students and university staff. But while Anoosh Chakelian found some sympathy for the project, others questioned whether it would simply enable attacks on marginalised groups while avoiding repercussions.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/business-and-finance/2018/08/money-diaries-how-salacious-stories-overdrafts-replaced-sex&quot;&gt;The money diaries: how salacious stories of overdrafts replaced sex advice for millennials&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	Money diaries have become a staple of newspapers and websites in recent years, with readers lapping up stories about over or underspending. But, wrote Anoosh Chakelian, it’s a trend driven by our desire to judge people for how they live their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/business-and-finance/2018/08/money-diaries-how-salacious-stories-overdrafts-replaced-sex&quot;&gt;Crumbling Britain: The quiet decline of English courts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	The impact of austerity has stretched beyond areas such as education and health into the justice system. As Patrick Maguire found out when he visited Buxton, court closures across the country are denying citizens access to justice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2018/09/somerset-northamptonshire-why-councils-collapsing&quot;&gt;Why are councils collapsing?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	Throughout 2018, Anoosh Chakelian carefully followed the wave of crises affecting local government as a result of swingeing cuts to their budgets. The most high-profile case was the collapse of Northamptonshire County Council, a Tory run authority that was forced to vote to scrap itself after declaring itself bankrupt in February.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/health/2018/04/alfie-evans-alder-hey-protesters-army&quot;&gt;Alfie’s Other Army: the parents and doctors defending Alder Hey Children’s Hospital&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	One of the year’s most high-profile stories was the case of Alfie Evans, a baby whose parents were fighting to stop doctors removing life support. While for many around the world the story was about cruel doctors denying a child care, Anoosh Chakelian spoke to the doctors, nurses and their supporters who were standing up for the medical professionals at Alder Hey Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2018/04/not-technically-beautiful-she-has-engaging-laugh-35-years-being-described-men&quot;&gt;“Not technically beautiful, she has an engaging laugh”: 35 years of being described by men&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	Tracey Thorn’s columns are much loved by&lt;em&gt; New Statesman&lt;/em&gt; readers, but this year one in particular, about being described by male music journalists, hit a nerve. As Tracey wrote: “You miss things when you leave women out, or view female characters through the prism of their attractiveness”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2018/10/how-stop-agitators-such-tommy-robinson-exploiting-child-grooming-trials&quot;&gt;How to stop agitators such as Tommy Robinson exploiting child grooming trials&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	While the rise of Tommy Robinson was part of a broader resurgence of the far right, his own profile has been boosted by a focus on “asian grooming gangs”. As Helen Lewis wrote, Robinson was only able to capitalise on the issue because the British courts and press have not done enough to ensure that justice is seen to be done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/feminism/2018/10/why-are-we-surprised-universal-credit-hurts-women-was-plan-after-all&quot;&gt;Why are we surprised Universal Credit hurts women? That was the plan, after all&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In yet another example of the problems with Universal Credit, MPs complained in late October that the way in which Universal Credit is paid into one family bank account put women at risk of financially-controlling partners, effectively depriving them of the means to escape violent or abusive households. But as Anoosh Chakelian argued, the system’s “family first” approach was always set to penalise women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2018/05/crumbling-britain-lancashire-s-lost-world-deep-sea-fishing&quot;&gt;Crumbling Britain: Lancashire’s lost world of deep-sea fishing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	Fishing has had an outsized place in the British national debate, in particular in regards to the UK’s relationship with the EU. But as Patrick Maguire found out in Lancashire, even the museums dedicated to remembering a now decimated industry are kept open only by volunteers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2018/06/crumbling-britain-uk-s-pothole-plague-sign-national-decline&quot;&gt;Crumbling Britain: the UK’s pothole plague is a sign of national decline&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	Compared to welfare cuts or service closures, potholes may seem a minor problem for the UK’s politicians. But as Anoosh Chakelian wrote, they are not just the most visible symbol of Britain’s crumbling public realm, but also a highly motivating issue that could go a long way to causing the downfall of the country’s leaders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2018/11/how-london-became-city-where-luxury-flats-sit-empty-and-homeless-shiver-railway&quot;&gt;How London became a city where luxury flats sit empty and the homeless shiver in railway arches&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	From a marginal problem a decade ago to a nationwide crisis, homelessness moved up the agenda in 2018. Helen Lewis dug behind the visible manifestation of the UK’s failure to look after its most vulnerable to examine the country’s broken housing market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/staggers/2018/10/austerity-over-philip-hammond-promised-not-rough-sleepers-it-s-not&quot;&gt;“Austerity is over,” Philip Hammond promised. Not for rough sleepers it’s not&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Lastly, in October, Jonn Elledge criticised the Chancellor&#039;s budget for its failure to even engage with one of the most visible social crises currently shaming Britain: the return of rough sleeping.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;
	From Brazil to Italy, 2018 showed the populist wave is not over yet. Meanwhile, in the US and the UK, the human consequences of voting for an anti-immigration populist message became horrifyingly clear. And the world continued to be fascinated by the flirtation between US president Donald Trump and his North Korean equivalent, Kim Jong-Un. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/world/north-america/2018/07/abilio-s-story-nine-year-old-separated-his-father-us-border&quot;&gt;Abilio’s story: the nine-year-old separated from his father at the US border&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Between April and June, more than 2,500 children were separated from their parents by the Trump administration. Sophie McBain tells the story of one such nine-year-old boy, Abilio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/world/middle-east/2018/08/secret-history-mossad-israel-s-feared-and-respected-intelligence-agency&quot;&gt;The secret history of Mossad, Israel’s feared and respected intelligence agency&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Israeli intelligence from the outset occupied a shadow realm, separate from the country’s democratic institutions, writes Ronan Bergman.  From the beginning, it was kept officially hidden from the Israeli public. David Ben-Gurion forbade anyone from acknowledging, let alone revealing, that this sprawling web of official institutions even existed. In fact, mentioning the name Shin Bet or Mossad in public was prohibited until the 1960s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/world/middle-east/2018/10/drinking-whisky-ruins-idlib-syria-s-last-bastion-resistance&quot;&gt;Drinking whisky in the ruins of Idlib, Syria’s last bastion of resistance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The province of Idlib is the last significant piece of ground held by rebels in Syria. Around three million civilians are there, alongside 90,000 armed men. When it falls, wrote Jeremy Bowen from the frontline in October, the war against Assad will finally be lost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/brexit/2018/10/britain-has-gaslit-eu-citizens-me-who-loved-it-s-why-i-ve-left&quot;&gt;Britain has gaslit EU citizens like me who loved it. That’s why I’ve left&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As a student in France, Pauline Bock dreamed of moving to London. So her family were disbelieving when two and a half years after the EU referendum, she left. “I didn’t leave because I had to. I still have the right to live in the UK,” she writes. “I left because I’d had enough – of the Brexiteers’ total ignorance and rancid rivalities, of the jolly spirit in which one assumes all will be right while the UK is led to the brink of collapse, and of being called an EU citizen like it’s some kind of insult.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/world/middle-east/2018/06/close-encounter-british-isis-jihadis&quot;&gt;A close encounter with British Isis jihadis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In an interrogation room in Syria, reported Anthony Lloyd in June, two members of the notorious “Beatles” terror cell joke about hostages and reminisce about life in “cosmopolitan” west London.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	In October, Jair Bolsonaro won the Brazilian presidential election, and became the latest populist to gain power. In her October profile, Julia Blunck describes how his followers call him a “legend” in a jokey way that might be recognised by those familiar with the supporters of Donald Trump, “but Bolsonaro is a much more homegrown monster”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	Ascending to power soon after the end of imperial occupation and the Second World War, the Kims have flourished both in the blood of others, and of each other, writes Gavin Jacobson in this profile of North Korea’s ruling family. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt; &lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	The way in which we live our lives online is one of the most important stories of the 21st century. And in 2018 the &lt;em&gt;New Statesman&lt;/em&gt;’s writers remained at the forefront of efforts to uncover, explain and contextualise the huge and sometimes very strange shifts in our digital world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/science-tech/social-media/2018/10/it-could-ve-been-government-thing-why-generation-z-thinks&quot;&gt;“It could’ve been a government thing”: Why Gen Z thinks Madeleine McCann never existed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	The internet has enabled the rise and spread of conspiracy theories, and been blamed for the real world consequences. But while fantastical theories such as Pizzagate or QAnon may have been nourished primarily via social media, it’s a little harder to blame the existence of continuing speculation about the disappearance of Madeline McCann on our digital world when newspapers have been speculating wildly for decades. As Amelia Tait wrote, blaming younger generations on the web obscures a much more complex picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/tv-radio/2018/07/how-love-island-s-alex-became-incel-icon&quot;&gt;How &lt;em&gt;Love Island&lt;/em&gt;’s Alex became an incel icon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	Old and new media do not exist in isolation from each other, and they can collide with unusual and unexpected results. One such example cropped up over the summer when the Incel community – young men online, who blame women for their lack of sexual relationships – embraced Alex, one of the contestants on reality TV show &lt;em&gt;Love Island&lt;/em&gt;. As Sarah Manavis discovered, the perma-tanned doctor’s behaviour on the show provided an unhealthy role model for young disillusioned and dissatisfied men online.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/world/north-america/2018/03/she-says-facebook-brainwashed-her-husband-he-disagrees&quot;&gt;She says Facebook brainwashed her husband – he disagrees&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	Social media has also been blamed for the rise of Donald Trump and more extreme right wing views, and can even drive a wedge between loved ones, as Ameila Tait found when she interviewed an American couple: a woman who claims Facebook brainwashed her husband, and her husband who thinks it merely helped him open his eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/science-tech/internet/2018/03/i-hate-myself-lol-why-laugh-out-loud-means-everything&quot;&gt;I hate myself lol: Why “laugh out loud” means everything but &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	Digital communication has helped turbo charge the evolution of language in strange and interesting ways, changing the meaning of phrases and words in unexpected ways. Amelia Tait explored one of the most striking shifts, in her look at how “Why “laugh out loud” came to mean everything but.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/world/2018/03/forget-facebook-russian-agents-have-been-pretending-be-furries-tumblr&quot;&gt;Forget Facebook, Russian agents have been pretending to be furries on Tumblr &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	One of the biggest stories of 2018 involved revelations about the activities of the Russian troll from the Internet Research Agency. But while debate continues to rage about the scale of its impact on democratic elections, Mic Wright examined one of the stranger pastimes of Russian agents, their attempt to disrupt the porn and K-pop loving teens of Tumblr.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/science-tech/social-media/2018/08/how-architecture-themed-twitter-accounts-became-magnet-white&quot;&gt;How architecture-themed Twitter accounts became a magnet for white nationalism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/science-tech/social-media/2018/09/eco-fascism-ideology-marrying-environmentalism-and-white-supremacy&quot;&gt;Eco-fascism: The ideology marrying environmentalism and white supremacy thriving online&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	The rise of the far right online has been a key theme for the New Statesman’s online coverage, and in recent months it has taken in some of the weirder tangents taken by white nationalists and other extremists. As Sarah Manavis found out, this included both eco-fascists emphasising marrying a environmentalism with bigotry and eugenics, and architecture enthusiasts attempting to twist the history of Europe’s buildings to fit a racist world view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/feminism/2018/10/country-where-metoo-censored-china-s-feminists-have-be-creative-online&quot;&gt;In a country where #MeToo is censored, China’s feminists have to be creative online&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	China’s strict control of the internet poses problems for all kinds of civil movements – and that includes the country’s feminists. But while there have been examples of pushes for greater rights for women via the internet, the web’s limitations for effecting real change have become all too apparent, writes Sarah Ditum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/science-tech/internet/2018/10/why-invention-fridge-could-be-responsible-our-love-fake-news&quot;&gt;Why the invention of the fridge could be responsible for our love of fake news&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	Disinformation is nothing new, but 2018 saw concern over the rise of so called “fake news” hit new highs. While most of us might consider ourselves to clever to fall for false information, Ian Leslie argued that it is laziness rather than stupidity that makes us more susceptible to it online – and that you only have to look at the history of the kitchen to see why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/science-tech/social-media/2018/11/no-nut-november-insidious-internet-challenge-encouraging-men-not&quot;&gt;No Nut November: the insidious internet challenge encouraging men not to masturbate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	Toxic masculinity has found new outlets for ugly and uncontrolled expression on the web. But one of the most popular is actually all about repressing basic urges: Sarah Manavis looked at the strange and worrying rise of “No Nut November”.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--

	&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-821434ca-7fff-a74b-ba02-5a65b552db0b&quot;&gt;There are some in the FBPE (Follow Back, Pro-EU) community who claim that Brexit could have been stopped if the Labour leadership had abandoned Brexit. This is either arguable if applied to 2016 or just simply wrong since 2016. But in the turmoil that is likely to follow the vote on the Withdrawal Agreement in January, the Labour leadership will play a crucial role. This post is about what happens if Labour enable Brexit in any way. I am not suggesting they will (and hope they do not), but right now this is a significant enough possibility to be worth writing about.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-821434ca-7fff-a74b-ba02-5a65b552db0b&quot;&gt;The attitude of Corbyn loyalists is that Remainers have nowhere else to go besides Labour. If Labour enable Brexit, this will have no noticeable impact on how Remainers vote in any general election. They dismiss a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-labour-lib-dems-jeremy-corbyn-tory-deal-poll-yougov-a8685786.html&quot;&gt;poll&lt;/a&gt; that suggests Labour could lose a large number of votes by attacking the poll: it was funded by the People’s Vote campaign, and &lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-d6b4e57e-7fff-a55f-fa35-aafba3bad1fd&quot;&gt;“who believes polls?”&lt;/span&gt; A more thoughtful criticism is that you are bound to get a large number in any question who highlight Brexit, but general elections will be fought over many issues. In short, Remainers on the left will always vote Labour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-821434ca-7fff-a74b-ba02-5a65b552db0b&quot;&gt;I would agree that one poll tells you little about any future general election, but what it does reveal is the intensity of feeling over the Brexit issue. I think many among the Labour leadership and Corbyn loyalists fail to understand this. They prefer instead to misplace Remainers as the centrist enemy, and see attacks on Corbyn over Brexit as just one more means by which the centre and right of Labour attack Labour. This is a serious mistake.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-821434ca-7fff-a74b-ba02-5a65b552db0b&quot;&gt;That Brexit is more than just another issue or a passing fad seems clear. After the 2016 vote, around half the Remain vote was prepared to accept the result, but the other half was not. Through two years when the two major parties and the BBC regarded the decision as made and irreversible, Remainers built various organisations with the aim of reversing the vote. They held protest marches around the UK that gradually grew in size, culminating in the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/oct/20/70000-demand-new-brexit-vote&quot;&gt;biggest&lt;/a&gt; march in London since the Iraq war protest. Polls now suggest the Remain vote is more committed than the Leave vote, with a majority over either &lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-da6b763b-7fff-43dd-6fbd-9e4c38066027&quot;&gt;May’s deal&lt;/span&gt; or no-deal bigger than Leave’s margin in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-821434ca-7fff-a74b-ba02-5a65b552db0b&quot;&gt;Where does this passion and energy come from? It is obviously a big issue, but would the kind of Brexit favoured by Corbyn and some Labour and Tory MPs (close to Brexit In Name Only - BINO) really be such a big deal compared to staying in the EU? On an emotional level I think there are three reasons why it would be. First and foremost is the question of identity. Many people in the UK regard themselves as also European, and any form of Brexit is clearly a way of cutting the UK off from the rest of Europe. Second, I think there is a strong feeling that leaving the EU represents the triumph of ideological over rational argument. Once you let a campaign of the right won by illegal means triumph, you open the doors to more of the same. A third factor is empathy for the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/it-s-terrifying-how-brexit-day-is-leaving-london-s-eu-nationals-fearing-for-their-futures-a3797731.html&quot;&gt;position&lt;/a&gt; of European migrants in the UK, who are often friends, neighbours or colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-821434ca-7fff-a74b-ba02-5a65b552db0b&quot;&gt;If a sceptical Labour leadership want to know what would happen if they enabled Brexit, the best comparison I can suggest is how they felt after parliament voted to put UK troops alongside US troops in the Iraq invasion. The objection that there is no comparison because thousands of people died because of Iraq is beside the point. I’m not saying they are events of comparable importance, and they are completely different in nature. These things do not work on a kind of utilitarian rational level, but a more emotional sense of betrayal. In the case of Brexit a betrayal of identity, of evidence-based policy making, and the wellbeing of our friends, neighbours or colleagues.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-0750dde4-7fff-8115-5ff1-d10def9905de&quot;&gt;If you put these points to Corbyn loyalists you get a variety of responses that go from the misguided to downright depressing. The best, but misguided, is that a compromise is required to “heal the nation”. It is misguided for reasons I set out at length &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://mainlymacro.blogspot.com/2018/11/brexit-of-course-everyone-hates.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Anything close to BINO does not “take back control”, it does not give more resources to the NHS, and it will not end freedom of movement. In short, a soft Brexit fails to give Brexit voters what they voted for, and that will be quickly pointed out to them if they do not realise it themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-0750dde4-7fff-8115-5ff1-d10def9905de&quot;&gt;Another response is that Labour cannot afford to lose the votes of Labour Leavers in critical seats. Quite why Labour are more likely to lose Leave voters in these seats than Remain voters is never specified. The worst argument I have heard is that Corbyn is just following Labour policy agreed at conference: if you cannot see why that is the worst argument you are probably a Corbyn loyalist. [1] Actually, that is not quite true, because the worst arguments are Lexit arguments, but I and many &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/dec/27/four-reasons-jeremy-corbyn-wrong-eu-state-aid&quot;&gt;others&lt;/a&gt; have addressed them elsewhere. [2]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-821434ca-7fff-a74b-ba02-5a65b552db0b&quot;&gt;I have to be doubly careful in posts like these because I am what one Corbyn loyalist described as an &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-0233477c-7fff-0ccb-1e9a-ffbde2b3d894&quot;&gt;“arch-Remainer”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. The emotions I ascribe to many of those who campaign for Remain are also my own. Like many of the other economists who made up &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-29fbc707-7fff-d405-242c-2e8628789251&quot;&gt;Labour’s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_Advisory_Committee&quot;&gt;Economic Advisory Council&lt;/a&gt; I resigned because I saw the current leadership as too content with the referendum result. As a result I am not an impartial observer, so I need to be especially careful that what I write about Remainers as a whole is factually based. No doubt what I say in this post will be dismissed for exactly that reason [3]. But what cannot be dismissed is that there have been two major grassroots movements in the last 20 years in the UK that managed to put more than half a million people on the streets of London, and there is a distinct danger that Labour will be on the wrong side of both of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-821434ca-7fff-a74b-ba02-5a65b552db0b&quot;&gt;What the precise consequences of Labour enabling Brexit would be are impossible to say. Less enthusiasm and fewer votes, for sure, but who knows whether they would be critical when it came to the establishment of a new party or a general election. The more relevant question is why take this significant risk. I have to return to my &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://mainlymacro.blogspot.com/2018/12/are-labour-leadership-attitudes-to.html&quot;&gt;comparison&lt;/a&gt; with austerity. Pre-Corbyn Labour collapsed in part because they toyed with accepting full-on austerity at just the point that austerity was becoming unpopular. Right now, Corbyn Labour are toying with enabling Brexit because they worry about Leave votes that are now &lt;a href=&quot;https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/economics/research/centres/cage/manage/publications/394-2018_fetzer.pdf&quot;&gt;moving&lt;/a&gt; to Remain. When Brexit will not free the UK from state aid rules, will not heal the nation, and will only lose you votes, it is time for the Labour leadership to put ideology aside and help take the issue back to the people.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-5d3e5e73-7fff-14c2-0d54-ecc24c79628b&quot;&gt;[1] The overwhelming majority of Labour members are Remainers and want a People’s Vote. What is agreed at conference is heavily influenced by the leadership.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-5d3e5e73-7fff-14c2-0d54-ecc24c79628b&quot;&gt;[2] What I would add is that Lexit contains a similar contradiction to Brexit. Just as Brexiteers cannot get a trade agreement with the EU without accepting the backstop, so any trade deal with the EU (including being part of a customs union) will require following EU rules on state aid. So the only form of Lexit possible is no-deal, which is a hell of a price to pay to avoid state aid rules.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-5d3e5e73-7fff-14c2-0d54-ecc24c79628b&quot;&gt;[3] As someone put it to me in a tweet, this is exactly what someone who supported Owen Smith would say. Which is something of a tautology as the only significant policy difference between Smith and Corbyn was Brexit. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

	&lt;em&gt;New Statesman America&lt;/em&gt; served up a lavish mix of in-depth coverage throughout 2018, looking into everything from the ongoing drumbeat of the Mueller investigation and the fight over Trump’s Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh to an in-depth guide to how to fix American democracy, a graphic novel-drawn story about the surprising history of the first openly gay superhero, and a public library in Seattle fighting against homelessness. Here’s a selection of some of &lt;em&gt;New Statesman America&lt;/em&gt;’s top pieces from the last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/world/north-america/2018/11/eight-simple-steps-fix-american-democracy&quot;&gt;Eight simple steps to fix American democracy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	How democratic is the United States? According to a poll released by the bipartisan Democracy Project in June, a clear majority (55 per cent) of Americans consider US democracy to be “weak”, with two-thirds (68 per cent) saying it’s “getting weaker.” Half of Americans believe the nation is in “real danger of becoming a non-democratic, authoritarian country”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In this detailed piece of solutions-oriented journalism, columnist and commentator Mehdi Hasan outlines the concrete steps which would fix America’s ailing democratic institutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/world/north-america/2018/09/without-our-consent&quot;&gt;Without Our Consent&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There are moments when the mask comes off. Moments when you can see the stitching come apart on the seamless story powerful men have told themselves about what justice means in the world and who deserves it. Sometimes that curtain gets ripped away and we all have to pay attention to what’s cowering and snarling behind it. That is what has happened in the high-stakes courtroom drama of Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination hearings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In this essay of controlled fury, Laurie Penny unpacks what the Kavanaugh hearings showed about how power operates in patriarchy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/world/north-america/2018/10/i-was-dennis-hof-s-last-ever-interview-night-he-died-what-i-learned&quot;&gt;I was Dennis Hof’s last ever interview, on the night he died. This is what I learned.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Working on a profile, Nicky Woolf went to see the brothel-owner, reality TV star, and “Trump of Pahrump” speak at his birthday party in Nevada. Porn star Ron Jeremy, Hof’s closest friend, gave a spirited rendition of “Oh When The Saints Go Marching In” on a harmonica. Anti-tax activist and conservative sage Grover Norquist spoke; signed copies of his book were auctioned off to raise money for a local dog shelter. Disgraced former Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio gave a rambling speech. Fox News host Tucker Carlson called in live on the air to say happy birthday. Through it all, Hof held court from the dais with a grin. Twelve hours later he was dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/world/north-america/2018/11/blue-wave-will-these-progressive-candidates-shake-midterms-way-they&quot;&gt;Blue Wave: will these progressive candidates shake up the midterms? In a way, they already have&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In November, an unprecedented “blue wave” swept into power the youngest, most diverse, and most progressive Congress in American history. In this set of profiles, Sophie McBain interviews some of the most prominent and exciting new candidates changing the face of American politics and standing up to the political establishment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/world/2018/08/qanon-inside-4chan-conspiracy-suggests-donald-trump-secret-genius&quot;&gt;QAnon: inside the 4Chan conspiracy that suggests Donald Trump is a secret genius&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	On 15 June 2018, Matthew Phillip Wright, a 30-year-old marine corps veteran from Henderson, Nevada, drove a homemade armoured truck to the middle of a bridge near the Hoover Dam in Arizona. He parked, blocking traffic, and got out. In one hand he was carrying a sign which said “Release the OIG report”, a reference to an investigation by the US Justice Department’s Office of the Inspector-General into Hillary Clinton’s email server scandal that had in fact already been released to the public earlier that week. In his other hand he was holding an AR-15 assault rifle. Nicky Woolf takes deep look inside QAnon, the dangerous – and extremely weird – conspiracy theory that drove Wright to the bridge that day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/cartoons/2018/12/alpha-flight-surprising-story-marvel-comics-little-known-canadian&quot;&gt;Alpha Flight: the surprising story of Marvel Comics’ little-known Canadian superheroes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Marvel’s obscure Canadian superhero group gave us a number of societal watermarks. The first-ever gay superhero. The first-ever superhero with dwarfism – who may well have been the inspiration for Tyrion Lannister. It also gave us one of the first instances of an episodic adventure series in any medium abruptly killing off a lead character for shock value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In this lavish story, drawn in comic-book style, writer and artist Tony Wolf takes us into the surprising world of Alpha Flight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/world/north-america/2018/09/what-steve-bannon-really-believes&quot;&gt;What Steve Bannon really believes in&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Bannon, the former Breitbart chief and architect of Trump’s 2016 electoral victory, hit headlines again in 2018 as he embarked on a controversial – and often-challenged – speaking tour. After a slated appearance at the &lt;em&gt;New Yorker &lt;/em&gt;festival in New York was cancelled, Sophie McBain looks deeper at this mercurial and controversial figure, and asks: does he just believe in winning? Or is there something deeper?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/world/north-america/2018/05/pulling-out-iran-deal-donald-trump-has-ushered-end-american-era&quot;&gt;By pulling out of the Iran deal, Donald Trump has ushered in the end of the American era&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The president walked away. Not just from an agreement that was working well. Not only from nations that took us at our word. He walked away from a time honoured tradition of Washington playing a primary role in holding up the international order. It’s a singular position America has occupied on the world stage since the end of the Cold War. Security, economic, political stability has depended on its presence. Donald Trump knocked it down with a bulldozer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Brett Bruen, who served on President Obama’s National Security Council, outlines the lasting and catastrophic damage Trump is wreaking on the global community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/world/north-america/2018/12/how-seattle-s-public-library-stepping-deal-city-s-homelessness-crisis&quot;&gt;How Seattle’s public library is stepping up to deal with the city’s homelessness crisis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Home to Starbucks, Boeing, Microsoft and Amazon, Seattle is booming. Yet the liberal West Coast city also has the third-largest homeless population in the country. Here, approximately 12,500 people live on the streets. That’s one in 175 residents of King County, the greater Seattle area. 200 homeless people die on its streets every year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In this piece, Daniel Rey looks at how a pioneering public organisation – Seattle’s public library – is taking a stand against the growing problem of homelessness on the West Coast and, in so doing, is re-defining the very idea of what a library is and does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/world/2018/08/democratic-socialist-america-alexandria-ocasio-cortezs-mission&quot;&gt;A democratic socialist in America: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s mission&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In the speech that followed her stunning victory in New York’s Democratic congressional primary on 26 June, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez promised her supporters: “This is only the beginning.” She was right: in November the 29-year-old Ocasio-Cortez became the youngest woman ever elected to Congress in November, and is already rewriting the rules of American politics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In August, Sophie McBain profiled the then-candidate who would go on to take America by storm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/america/politics/2018/11/impeaching-trump-won-t-and-can-t-work-we-should-try-it&quot;&gt;Impeaching Trump won’t and can’t work. But we should try it&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Despite the Democrat victory in the House, impeaching Trump remains practically impossible, Nicky Woolf writes. But while the constitution states that impeachment requires a two-thirds majority in the Senate to pass, so even if the Democrats had won every swing seat they lost on Tuesday they still wouldn’t have anywhere near the votes they need in the Senate. So: it’s a no-go. ...Mostly. While it is true that bringing impeachment, as it were, to completion, is extremely unlikely, it’s not impossible. Trump is protected not by an impenetrable wall, but by people: specifically, the Republican Party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/world/north-america/2018/08/donald-trump-and-michael-cohen-comprehensive-timeline&quot;&gt;Donald Trump and Michael Cohen: a comprehensive timeline&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In December, Trump’s former lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen was sentenced to three years in prison for a “smorgasbord” of offences. In this comprehensive timeline, Sophie McBain goes right back to the beginning to chart the course which led Cohen to this tragic denouement. Could it spell legal trouble for Trump too? Only time will tell.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--

    <title>The rise of the 2017 intake reflects the surprising endurance of Theresa May</title>
    <link>https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2018/12/rise-2017-intake-reflects-surprising-endurance-theresa-may</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-subheadline field-type-text-long field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;
	The prime minister has appointed Andrew Bowie, a Scottish Tory first elected last year, as her parliamentary private secretary.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-node-image field-type-image field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;noscript class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoints=&quot;300 768 1024&quot; data-adaptive-image-300-img=&quot;&amp;lt;img class=&amp;quot;adaptive-image&amp;quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&amp;quot;300&amp;quot; typeof=&amp;quot;foaf:Image&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2018/12/gettyimages-1071989816_0.jpg?itok=YMqTbP3G&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;Theresa May&amp;quot; title=&amp;quot;Theresa May&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&quot; data-adaptive-image-768-img=&quot;&amp;lt;img class=&amp;quot;adaptive-image&amp;quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&amp;quot;768&amp;quot; typeof=&amp;quot;foaf:Image&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2018/12/gettyimages-1071989816_0.jpg?itok=YMqTbP3G&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;Theresa May&amp;quot; title=&amp;quot;Theresa May&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&quot; data-adaptive-image-1024-img=&quot;&amp;lt;img class=&amp;quot;adaptive-image&amp;quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&amp;quot;1024&amp;quot; typeof=&amp;quot;foaf:Image&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2018/12/gettyimages-1071989816_0.jpg?itok=YMqTbP3G&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;Theresa May&amp;quot; title=&amp;quot;Theresa May&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&quot; data-adaptive-image-max-img=&quot;&amp;lt;img class=&amp;quot;adaptive-image&amp;quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&amp;quot;max&amp;quot; typeof=&amp;quot;foaf:Image&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2018/12/gettyimages-1071989816_0.jpg?itok=YMqTbP3G&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;Theresa May&amp;quot; title=&amp;quot;Theresa May&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&quot;&gt;&lt;img typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2018/12/gettyimages-1071989816_0.jpg?itok=YMqTbP3G&quot; alt=&quot;Theresa May&quot; title=&quot;Theresa May&quot; /&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt; &lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	Having made do with one for the last six months, Theresa May now has two Commons cornermen at her disposal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Belatedly replacing George Hollingbery – who was appointed to full ministerial rank in June – is Scottish Tory MP Andrew Bowie. He gets a late Christmas present in the shape of a promotion from his current gig assisting the junior ministers at the Department for Digital, Culture, Media &amp;amp; Sport to that of parliamentary private secretary to the prime minister.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	His has been a rapid rise: close to Ruth Davidson, he was the first of the 12 Scottish Conservative MPs who won their seats in 2017 to be given a government job, and is now arguably the most senior member of the 32-strong 2017 intake on the payroll. History suggests that rise will continue: recent holders of senior ministerial posts like Gavin Williamson and Sam Gymiah began their lives in government as PPS to David Cameron.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But should we care? The government’s PPS team – a squadron of unpaid MPs who act as the eyes and ears of ministers – has been much more conspicuous than usual in this parliament, in part because of frequent resignations from their ranks over Brexit. The popular (and lazy) conclusion drawn from that high degree of attrition is that the roles are meaningless and their occupants about as important – or worthy of public recognition – as primary school milk monitors. Asking who a PPS is &lt;em&gt;after &lt;/em&gt;they announce their resignation from government is a very easy sport, and one that finds a dispiriting number of people who are literally paid to pay attention to these jobs, and those who hold them, all too keen to participate in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The irony, of course, is that by quitting their jobs those MPs are advertising their significance, rather than the other way round. In a minority parliament whose executive is run by a prime minister with a singular aversion to working on a cross-party basis and a Brexit policy that has all but permanently lost the support of DUP, the cost of losing a member of the payroll vote is massive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Take the last PPS resignation: in the immediate term, the government can of course function without Will Quince helping Gavin Williamson with his Instagram hashtags and other important Ministry of Defence business; several other cabinet ministers have been without them for some months too. But it is much less clear how the government survives Quince, and dozens of other former payroll members like him, voting against the project it exists to implement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Then there is the question of how effective a minister, especially in this febrile climate, can be without a trusted and effective PPS. Most would say not very. That people on Twitter haven’t heard of them is neither here nor there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Bowie, though, was never on resignation watch. His appointment is a reward for ability and loyalty rather than a last-gasp inducement to it: he is a supporter of both May and the withdrawal agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But what Bowie isn’t is a devout ideological Mayite: indeed, relatively few MPs are. Like many of his intake he is a supporter of Freer, the free market thinktank championed by Liz Truss, the hawkish Chief Secretary to the Treasury (Onward, another new Tory policy shop, is chaired by 2017er Neil O’Brien). Add to that the state the government finished the last parliamentary term in – and the gloomy prognosis for May’s premiership generally – and you might wonder what is in this gig for an ambitious young MP with an appetite for a dynamic new domestic policy agenda, especially given the payroll exodus of recent months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	What’s interesting about that exodus, however, is that only one of those 22 Brexit resignations came from a member of the 2017 intake – Ben Bradley, who quit as a Conservative Party vice-chair in July. another 15 still hold government jobs, most as PPSs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	By comparison, only nine said they could not support the prime minister’s withdrawal agreement: Bradley, Ross Thomson, Andrew Lewer, Lee Rowley, Damien Moore, Douglas Ross, John Lamont, Julia Lopez and Giles Watling. Of these only three – Bradley, Rowley and Lewer – publicly declared they had no confidence in the prime minister earlier this month. So despite their ideological diversity and diverging views on Brexit, a clear majority of the 2017 intake supports the May ministry or believes it to be in their political self-interest to work for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	That fact is a salutary reminder of the power Downing Street retains. The prime minister’s opponents within and without the Conservative Party often contend that she is in office but not in power. That might be true as far as the Commons as a whole is concerned but when it comes to her parliamentary party, May is – for the next eleven months at least – the only show in town. The power of patronage is and will remain hers alone: for the foreseeable future, there is little alternative for ambitious Tories who want to do things and get on but to get to work and get Brexit done, lest another snap election taketh away what 2017 giveth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For these reasons, some on the Tory benches suspect that the outlook could be a shade brighter for May come the meaningful vote than the apocalyptic outcome most expect.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;
	The &lt;em&gt;New Statesman &lt;/em&gt;delved deep into the music world in 2018, with everyone from Sting to Lily Allen, from Taylor Swift to Mark E. Smith and the return of Sade, from Scientology on Planet Beck to the race against time to save the music of the victims of the Holocaust. Here’s a selection of some of the top pieces of music coverage from the last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/music-theatre/2018/03/i-call-him-pope-jamaica-encounter-shaggy-and-sting&quot;&gt;“I call him the Pope of Jamaica”: An encounter with Shaggy and Sting&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Kate Mossman interviews rock’s oddest couple about Trump, Brexit, privilege and the perils of the public laundromat, and finds that they’re not as different as you might think: Shaggy and Sting are the twin poles of masculine libido – one pursuing bikinied booty on a beach like a sniffer dog; the other a paragon of psychosexual stamina, who’d mastered the practice of tantric yoga.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/music-theatre/2018/03/queen-quiet-storm-tracey-thorn-return-sade&quot;&gt;The queen of “quiet storm”: Tracey Thorn on the return of Sade&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Sade mixed slick soul with social realism to create a unique sound. A goddess, a queen. Yet of course, behind all that she’s a real person: Helen Folasade Adu, born in Nigeria in 1959 to a Nigerian academic and an English nurse. When her parents separated she moved back to England with her mother and brother, growing up in Essex listening to Curtis Mayfield, Donny Hathaway and Bill Withers. Now, after eight years, she’s back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/music-theatre/2018/01/mark-e-smith-sudden-end-forty-years-prole-art-threat&quot;&gt;Mark E Smith: A sudden end to forty years of prole art threat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	“The great thing about rock and roll is, any idiot can play it. The bad thing about rock and roll is, any idiot can play it.” Many personal recollections of Mark E Smith bubbled up on social media when the death of this singular figure – tyrannical owner-operator and sole permanent component of The Fall, most curmudgeonly man in pop, and possibly the last member of the punk generation still engaged in intellectual jihad against sonic acceptability – was announced on January 24. But these lines, half-remembered by ex-WYNU DJ Hugh Foley from his interview with Smith in the 1980s, said it best, Andrew Harrison writes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/2018/08/ariana-grande-sweetner-review-manchester-attacks-anxiety-lyrics&quot;&gt;How Ariana Grande floated free&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Grande is the model of a modern pop star – her child fans appreciate her most for her “relatability”; she tweets them directly and says empowering things, writes Kate Mossman. But &lt;em&gt;One Love&lt;/em&gt; was an exercise in saying nothing, powerfully. The new album is an exercise in restraint, too. After her concert in Manchester was victim to the terrible bomb attack, an artist reinvents herself and comes of age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/music-theatre/2018/10/taylor-swift-political-republican-democrat&quot;&gt;The long, political career of Taylor Swift&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	After Swift broke her political silence to endorse a Democratic candidate in November’s midterm elections, Anna Leszkiewicz charts the course of pop’s brightest star as she navigates a changing political climate with considerable, if decreasing, deftness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/2018/09/Steve-Perry-Journey-lead-singer-Dont-Stop-Believin-interview&quot;&gt;Steve Perry of Journey: “Things happened to me as a child. There was nowhere to talk it out, so I sang it out instead”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Journey wrote “Don’t Stop Believin’”, the most downloaded song from the 20th century. When their lead singer quit, the band spent years trying to replace him. Finally out of hibernation, he tells his strange story to Kate Mossman over chocolate muffins in a Whitehall hotel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/2018/05/lily-allen-why-metoo-hasnt-hit-music-industry&quot;&gt;Lily Allen: why #MeToo hasn&#039;t hit the music industry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	“Things have become so sanitised,” says Allen, now 33. “A lot of my honesty, and wanting to be as authentic as possible, came from coming out of bands like S Club 7 – things that felt glossy, you know? And with the rise of social media there was an initial backlash against that glossiness, too. And then, I don’t know, somehow it managed to get lost again. For anyone who wants to express themselves, there is a platform for people to criticise that expression. People would rather their timeline was full of ‘You’re brilliant’ and ‘You look amazing’ than ‘fuck you’.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/music-theatre/2018/02/some-women-will-shag-anything-get-anywhere-lisa-stansfield-fame&quot;&gt;“Some women will shag anything to get anywhere”: Lisa Stansfield on fame, Weinstein and the problem with Jeremy Corbyn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	She was the biggest British female soul star of the Nineties. At 51, she’s back and ready to let loose. “You’ve got people with no integrity whatsoever who will look at a person like me, fresh off the boat and go: ‘Yeah, I can have a bit of that, I can fuck that right up. I’ll make as much money out of it as I can, and than I’ll shove it to one side’,” she tells the &lt;em&gt;New Statesman &lt;/em&gt;in this candid interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/music-theatre/2018/05/one-man-s-race-bring-forgotten-music-holocaust-life&quot;&gt;One man’s race to bring the forgotten music of the Holocaust to life&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Francesco Lotoro knows time is short. “It is an emergency,” he tells me. “These people are 96, 97, 100 years old.” Julia Rampen speaks to a man on a mission: to save the music of the Holocaust. He first learned of the music of prisoners in 1988, and has been collecting it ever since. The 8,000 musical scores he has uncovered over the ensuing years are written on everything from postcards to lavatory paper, or learned by heart. More than 10,000 items, Lotoro believes, are still waiting to be deciphered. “The Imperial War Museum is full, full, full, full of music,” he says. “I went there – it was a mess. The music’s there but nobody can listen to it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/music-theatre/2018/01/i-miss-people-i-have-longing-connection-and-human-contact-life-planet&quot;&gt;“I miss people. I have a longing for connection and human contact”: life on Planet Beck&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Beck’s voice is level and rather quiet, sometimes little more than a crack. He is 5ft 6in and wears a grey herringbone blazer, grey V-neck and jeans. He has two staff present, but no one objects when I ask them to leave. His eyes are big and blue. This, perhaps, is a Scientologist’s famous stare in the flesh. It is not confrontational – more, if anything, like being looked through, passive and slightly hypnotic. You instinctively find yourself returning it, from politeness, or from some inbuilt desire not to “flunk” and lose the match. As the afternoon wears on, the effect of looking so hard at Beck in the fading light is slightly hallucinogenic. At times, he goes fuzzy at the edges, reports Kate Mossman.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--

	The &lt;em&gt;New Stateman &lt;/em&gt;spent 2018 profiling and interviewing some of the most interesting cultural, intellectual and political public figures. Here&#039;s a selection of some of the highlights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/economy/2018/09/who-real-john-mcdonnell&quot;&gt;Who is the real John McDonnell?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The journey from Marxist ideologue to shadow chancellor has been a long one, but now faced with the prospect of power, Jeremy Corbyn’s closest ally is turning his passion to pragmatism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2018/08/rabbi-jonathan-sacks-hate-begins-jews-never-ends-jews&quot;&gt;Rabbi Jonathan Sacks: “The hate that begins with Jews never ends with Jews”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In an incendiary interview that sparked headlines around the world, the UK’s former chief rabbi talked about outsourcing morality, peace between Israel and Palestine, and why Jews feel threatened by Corbyn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/observations/2018/10/francis-fukuyama-interview-socialism-ought-come-back&quot;&gt;Francis Fukuyama interview: “Socialism ought to come back”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;The End of History&lt;/em&gt; author on the return of socialism, threats to democracy, and what his critics get wrong about his most famous book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/books/2018/09/sally-rooney-interview-normal-people-booker-prize-bbc-three-adaptation-conversations-with-friends&quot;&gt;Sally Rooney on sex, power and the art of being normal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Booker-nominated author has been hailed as the voice of the Millennial generation, with exhaustive attention to the minute details of human interaction. She talks lasting relationships, literary prizes, and being “normal”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2018/10/sean-bean-jeremy-corbyn-does-actually-believe-what-he-stands&quot;&gt;Sean Bean: “Jeremy Corbyn does actually believe in what he stands for”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The &lt;em&gt;Medici&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt; actor talks Thersa May, sword fighting, and checking scripts to see if he ends up dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2018/04/even-old-age-philosopher-bryan-magee-remains-wonder-struck-ultimate-questions&quot;&gt;Even in old age, philosopher Bryan Magee remains wonderstruck by the ultimate questions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Once a broadcaster, politician, author and poet, in old age the renowned philosopher lives in one room in a nursing hospital. And yet Jason Cowley finds a mind that still roams restlessly free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2018/02/polite-extremist-jacob-rees-mogg-s-seemingly-unstoppable-rise&quot;&gt;The polite extremist: Jacob Rees-Mogg’s seemingly unstoppable rise&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The eccentric Brexiteer figurehead has ridden the post-referendum wave to become one of the most high-profile Tory MPs and even a potential prime minister. Martin Fletcher asks, how dangerous is he?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/2018/02/rapid-rise-laura-pidcock-labour-mp-tipped-possible-successor-corbyn&quot;&gt;The rapid rise of Laura Pidcock – the Labour MP tipped as a possible successor to Corbyn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Tipped as a future Labour leadership contender, the shadow labour minister and Corbyn loyalist loathes “the exoticisation of the working class” in politics. She talks to Anoosh Chakelian about Lexit, deselection and why she won’t be friends with Tories.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2018/11/banana-republic-boris-johnson&quot;&gt;The Banana Republic of Boris Johnson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Boris Johnson’s opportunistic backing of the campaign to leave the EU put him into one of the great offices of state, only to see him resign over Brexit negotiations after becoming a laughing stock for gaffes and perceived incompetence.Martin Fletcher picks apart a very British charlatan.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2018/11/what-rise-piers-morgan-tells-us-about-modern-britain&quot;&gt;What the rise of Piers Morgan tells us about modern Britain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As a precocious tabloid editor, bullish presenter, friend of Trump and Twitter provocateur, Morgan has found the fame he dreamed of. But, asks Tanya Gold, is there anything beneath the oily exterior?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/observations/2018/02/why-antonio-gramsci-marxist-thinker-our-times&quot;&gt;Why Antonio Gramsci is the Marxist thinker for our times&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	More than 80 years after his death, the Italian Marxist’s theories of hegemony have proved startlingly prescient. George Eaton assesses his legacy. &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--

    <title>Theresa May bribes Tory MPs with Christmas honours ahead of the Brexit vote</title>
    <link>https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2018/12/theresa-may-bribes-tory-mps-christmas-honours-ahead-brexit-vote</link>

&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-994a5073-7fff-0e1f-f433-a341b54a1507&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;The appointments of Dunne and Gale, whose votes for the withdrawal agreement are guaranteed, are very much of the former category. Both have proved reliably sympathetic questioners for May in the Commons of late &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;–&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt; a rare quality in the current climate. Gale provided one of the more memorable moments of the meaningful vote debate when he told Boris Johnson that he “appears to be one of those who prefers the grievance to the solution. My right honourable friend the Prime Minister has come up with a solution. What’s his big idea?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-994a5073-7fff-0e1f-f433-a341b54a1507&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;Their loyalty has been rewarded. But will Leigh’s be induced? Of the three, the former chair of the Public Accounts Committee is the only stated opponent of May’s Brexit deal. Unlike many of his colleagues in and around the European Research Group, however, he is personally loyal to the Prime Minister if not her policy, and was the most senior of a number of veteran Eurosceptics to have cautioned against ousting her in November (a gambit that led disgruntled Brexiteers to suspect he was a “nark” for the Whips’ Office).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-994a5073-7fff-0e1f-f433-a341b54a1507&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;In short, Leigh is precisely the sort of MP who May will need to convince &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;–&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;by patronage or otherwise &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;–&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt; if she is to snatch a slightly less humiliating defeat from the jaws of the comically lopsided one she was heading for before the vote was postponed. While lots of Tory MPs are Eurosceptic and opposed to the deal, the calculation is that few of them are pathological wreckers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-994a5073-7fff-0e1f-f433-a341b54a1507&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;It’s worth noting, of course, that dispensing baubles hasn’t convinced other Brexiteers to recant: former minister John Hayes accepted a knighthood before coming out against the withdrawal agreement, while the elevation of the DUP’s Brexit spokesperson Sammy Wilson to the Privy Council earlier this year has achieved less than nothing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;But the hope is nonetheless that MPs like Leigh will come in from the cold, as Jack Lopresti, an ERG stalwart now serving as PPS to Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay, did last month. With several such government jobs as parliamentary private secretaries to senior ministers still being kept vacant by whips as “poor man’s knighthoods” for wavering MPs (as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2018/11/how-downing-street-planning-bribe-tory-mps-back-brexit-deal&quot;&gt;I revealed in November&lt;/a&gt;), and the announcement of actual knighthoods still to come, the road that Downing Street believes it can take to an unlikely victory &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;–&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt; or at least a respectable defeat &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;–&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt; is becoming plainer to see. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	UK politics in 2018 managed to deliver radical activity at the party level and virtually no progress in the biggest issue facing the country - Brexit. Through it all, the &lt;em&gt;New Statesman&lt;/em&gt; team were here to act as your guide. Below is just a small selection of our political coverage from the last 12 months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2018/08/labour-party-split-inevitable-corbyn-MPs&quot;&gt;Leaving Labour: why a party split is now inevitable&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The rise of Jeremy Corbyn has left large swathes of the parliamentary Labour party out in the cold. With divisions over Europe, anti-Semitism and much more, Stephen Bush tackled the question on everyone’s mind, is Britain’s main left wing party set to break apart?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2018/01/after-suffragettes-how-women-stormed-westminster&quot;&gt;After the suffragettes: how women stormed Westminster&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One the centenary of women winning the right to vote, Helen Lewis looks at how far things have come for women’s representation in Westminster, and how far there still is to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2018/08/jeremy-corbyn-s-two-universes&quot;&gt;Jeremy Corbyn’s two universes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While in Westminster Corbyn faced hostility from both the press and sections of his own party, at events over the summer he found in more welcoming crowd in places such as Mansfield and Stoke-on-Trent. Patrick Maguire trailed the leader’s road trip to see the other side of Corbyn’s two worlds.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2018/04/corbyn-ultimatum&quot;&gt;The Corbyn ultimatum&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In April, Unite Secretary General Len McClusky chose the pages of the New Statesman to deliver a message to Labour MPs – get behind Corbyn or face the consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2018/05/why-i-hate-ed-miliband-renaissance&quot;&gt;Why I hate the Ed Miliband renaissance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Once reviled as the man who lost to David Cameron in 2015, Ed Miliband has seen a return to the public eye in a new, sassy, internet-friendly incarnation. But while online the public have lapped up his renaissance, Annosh Chaeklian was more sceptical of the very British trend of fetishising politicians when they move on from power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2018/01/memes-are-not-way-look-it-inside-tory-membership-crisis&quot;&gt;“Memes are not the way to look at it”: inside the Tory membership crisis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While one of the great successes of the modern Labour party has been a huge expansion of its membership, particularly among the young, the Conservative Party has seen its paid-up supporters dwindle to a small rump of mostly older backers. And as Anoosh Chakelian reported, it will take a lot more than clever use of social media to reverse the trend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 data-analyticsid=&quot;/politics/uk/2018/11/forget-tory-psychodrama-real-crisis-threat-no-deal-brexit&quot;&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2018/11/forget-tory-psychodrama-real-crisis-threat-no-deal-brexit&quot;&gt;Forget the Tory psychodrama, the real crisis is the threat of a No Deal Brexit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As Conservative infighting over Brexit continued, Stephen Bush provided his regular and urgent reminder that what is at stake is much more than the future of the party or even who becomes prime minister. The Tory psychodrama could easily lead the UK off the cliff edge of leading an unprepared UK out of the EU without a deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/economy/2018/10/austerity-how-ideological-project-failed-its-own-terms&quot;&gt;Austerity: how an ideological project failed on its own terms&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Austerity has defined British politics in one way or another since the financial crash over a decade ago. But with promises of an end to belt-tightening remaining unfulfilled, and a visibly fraying public realm even the Conservatives have begun a retreat from their defining stance. George Eaton examines how their supposedly unavoidable project bit the dust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2018/12/new-statesman-s-z-political-year&quot;&gt;The New Statesman’s A to Z of the political year&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	From anti-Semitism to zero Brexit progress, Anoosh Chakelian and  Helen Lewis bring you the New Statesman’s roundup of 2018. &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--

	&lt;strong&gt;I thought that giving key Brexit jobs to Boris Johnson, David Davis and Liam Fox was a good move on Theresa May’s part&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This was the year in which a particularly bad piece of work from July 2016 finally took its last breath. It’s hard to zero in on any individual lowlight as there are so many contenders. The headline – &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/staggers/2016/07/sending-boris-johnson-foreign-office-bad-britain-good-theresa-may&quot;&gt;“Sending Boris Johnson to the Foreign Office is bad for Britain, good for Theresa May”&lt;/a&gt; – has aged better than the piece in that at least everything &lt;em&gt;before &lt;/em&gt;the comma has held up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	What I got wrong here was that I had completely misunderstood Theresa May’s governing style, which is to restrict political control to a trusted circle of herself and one or two trusted advisors. I knew from my Liberal Democrat sources from the coalition years that this was how she treated them and knew that she behaved in combat with George Osborne’s Treasury, but I thought this was because she saw those two forces as political opponents. I now know that this is May’s default political setting with essentially everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	By not sub-contracting Brexit out to Davis and by shrinking the Foreign Office’s power, May allowed both men to walk out with very little blame. The important lesson here is that you have to assess what a politician does through two prisms: the first is what they are &lt;em&gt;actually like &lt;/em&gt;and then what they want to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It may be that the damage that Davis and Johnson did both suffer to their reputations in their post did help May personally, in that if they had been free from ministerial office they might have seemed like plausible alternatives to her. One reason why May survived is that Conservative MPs felt that it was a choice between the devil they knew and wildly unsuitable alternatives. We can’t prove the counterfactual, but while May’s reshuffle didn’t work for the reasons I thought it would, it might have benefitted her in other ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;rtecenter&quot;&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;I was right that Labour’s strategic ambiguity on Brexit would last the year&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This is an interesting one – an analysis that is holding together as of 2018 but may well fall before March 2019. (Rather like the United Kingdom, in fact.) Could Labour continue to face both ways on Brexit? At the start of the year, I thought it would:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/staggers/2018/01/can-labour-keep-its-brexit-balancing-acthttps://www.newstatesman.com/politics/staggers/2018/01/can-labour-keep-its-brexit-balancing-act&quot;&gt;“Day-to-day, Labour’s ambiguity over Brexit is sustained by clever tactical work on the Labour side and May’s unwillingness to work with other parties.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/staggers/2018/01/can-labour-keep-its-brexit-balancing-acthttps://www.newstatesman.com/politics/staggers/2018/01/can-labour-keep-its-brexit-balancing-act&quot;&gt;That means that the only big bear trap for Labour is the vote on the deal itself, when Labour will have to commit to one or the other. But I don’t think they will get caught on that one, as the easy way out is just to vote it down because it does not secure ‘the best possible access’ to the single market, a form of words around which all of Labour can unite even as they disagree on the meaning.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One can fairly ask how much of that work has been “clever” and how much of it has been just good enough to overcome flat-footed opposition, but the pattern from the polls and the local elections is that Labour is still holding onto its 2017 coalition. It did suffer what seems to be a permanent downward change in its poll position, but that was over the Skripals (of which, more below).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;rtecenter&quot;&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;I thought Theresa May appointing Philip Hammond was a good move&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	My aforementioned 2016 piece on Boris Johnson’s position at the Foreign Office contained another howler. I thought that by appointing Philip Hammond as Chancellor, an early backer of her leadership, she had made the same essentially correct call as Jeremy Corbyn had in backing John McDonnell:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	“Just as with Jeremy Corbyn’s decision to overrule many of his own allies and put John McDonnell in as shadow chancellor, May will start with the all-important unity between Downing Street and the Treasury without which no government or opposition can prosper.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Of course, we now know that one of the many remarkable things about the May-Hammond relationship is that the latter chose to endorse the former without ever sitting down to discuss their stances on Brexit, the customs union, or the British economic model, while the former chose a Chancellor with whom she disagreed on the final shape of Brexit, Britain’s economic model and the public spending decisions taken from 2010 to 2016. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	So the Corbyn-McDonnell analogy is useful only in contrast: while Corbyn put his close ally in the vital shadow Treasury role, May set her closest ideological ally, Damian Green, to the post of Work and Pensions, and presumably wouldn’t even have done that had scandal not ended Stephen Crabb’s career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I don’t see how I could have avoided getting this one wrong, as it is a failure of political tradecraft so basic and so profound that it isn’t reasonable to believe that any senior politician – let alone &lt;em&gt;two &lt;/em&gt;senior politicians – would do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	What is less defensible is that it is only very recently – that is to say, in the back half of 2018 – that I absorbed the really important lesson, which is that Theresa May is not only bad at politics but appears to lack &lt;em&gt;any &lt;/em&gt;political sense whatsoever. It’s not so much that she makes political judgements that are bad, it’s that she doesn’t seem to make political judgements in a meaningful sense. Almost every analysis – mine and other people’s – which was based on the idea that there is a strategy beyond what is visible from the surface in May’s movements has ended up looking very bad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;rtecenter&quot;&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;I was right to be sceptical of the chances of another referendum&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	At the start of the year, Nigel Farage popped up to suggest that it might be a good idea to hold another referendum on whether the United Kingdom should stay in the European Union (it’s been a long year). I was sceptical that the idea would ever fly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/staggers/2018/01/nigel-farage-s-suggestion-second-referendum-would-struggle-pass-parliament&quot;&gt;“Any conversation about a second referendum has to start with a meaningful analysis of how you get 325 MPs to vote for it and how you get that vote in the first place. Brexit continues to have a number of powerful guarantors: Eurosceptics on the Conservative backbenches, Eurosceptics in the Labour leadership, pro-Remain Labour MPs in Leave-heavy seats who don&#039;t want to go the way of all flesh, to name just a few. Not only do you have to overcome all of that, but you have to overcome it all multiple times in a new referendum bill.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There are a few things I’d missed: I’d underestimated the opposition that even committed pro-European Conservative rebels like Nicky Morgan had to the idea, and for reasons that now escape me I hadn’t included Theresa May as a factor in her own right. But broadly that paragraph has held true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;rtecenter&quot;&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Though I briefly thought I wasn’t&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When Sam Gyimah quit as universities minister, I wrote that a parliamentary majority for a second referendum was now achievable as he was the type of Conservative MP who although we wouldn’t expect to back another vote would have to in order to overcome both the government’s majority and the Labour rebels who will vote against it come what may.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Although I knew that some more vocal pro-European Conservatives were against a referendum in private, I had underestimated how committed Nicky Morgan and Nick Boles were to resisting one until they went public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I’m intensely relaxed about this one – it’s important to change your analysis in the presence of new information in order to avoid being one of those people saying minutes before the 2017 exit poll that the only plausible outcome was a landslide for Theresa May.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;rtecenter&quot;&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;I completely failed to predict the damage that the Skripal row would do to Jeremy Corbyn&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Partly because of the political leanings of most of the commentariat, particularly those bits of the commentariat that writes about the Labour party, there has been a lot of ink spilt about the Labour party’s relationship with Remainers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The year has seen a decline in the Labour Party’s poll position, but the damage has been caused by Leave voters. While the party is still neck-and-neck with the Conservative Party, if everyone who was telling pollsters they were voting for the Labour Party at the start of 2018 was doing so at the end they would be ahead, as the Tory party’s position has also declined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	What’s driven the fall in Labour support is not Brexit but a shift in both the party’s and Jeremy Corbyn’s overall ratings – and it happened over a very brief period of time: after the Labour leader’s response to the poisoning of the Skripals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I didn’t think this would happen and at the time I was very cautious about rushing to conclude that it would necessarily harm Corbyn or that the polling damage would be longterm. I &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/elections/2018/03/how-much-will-jeremy-corbyn-s-stance-russia-hurt-his-electoral-chances&quot;&gt;noted that since parties tend to do bette&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/elections/2018/03/how-much-will-jeremy-corbyn-s-stance-russia-hurt-his-electoral-chances&quot;&gt;r&lt;/a&gt; when issues that they are seen as strong on are in the headlines – and the Conservatives are more trusted on security issues – Labour’s polling recessional might be temporary. I also thought that Corbyn’s dovish position on the issue &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/staggers/2018/03/stand-russia-has-set-labour-party-clock-back-spring-2017&quot;&gt;might strike a chord&lt;/a&gt; with an electorate that is still very nervous of confrontation in foreign policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I thought that, even though the attack happened on British soil, that it happened to two Russian nationals would mean that there would be a larger domestic caucus for Corbyn’s message of de-escalation than there was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I thought that the row would be the 2017 election all over again, when Corbyn gave an isolationist speech that was widely panned by pundits but – to my eyes at least – was clearly in tune with the vast majority of British voters post-Iraq. I was right in that instance but wrong in this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	My understanding of the contours of British isolationism and its political desires is not as good as it could be and something I’ll aim to improve on in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;rtecenter&quot;&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;I was too quick to dismiss Facebook’s influence on our changing politics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In February, I wrote a very sceptical piece &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/staggers/2018/03/facebook-cambridge-analytics-election-shares-stocks-brexit&quot;&gt;about the Cambridge Analytica revelations and their influence over the Brexit result&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I am still highly dubious about whether Cambridge Analytica had a significant role in the referendum outcome, as every story suggesting it did has overcooked the reach of its work and undercooked the reach and influence of the longstanding engines of pro-Brexit sentiment in our country (such the &lt;em&gt;Express, w&lt;/em&gt;hich spread like wildfire through Facebook in the run up to the vote).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But I think I overcorrected. Social media in general and Facebook in particular are the biggest changes to how we consume news and talk to one another in our history. In 1970 we would have regarded anyone claiming that the arrival of television as a mass medium hadn’t changed politics as an unutterable moron and, likewise, making the extraordinary claim that Facebook is not changing our politics requires extraordinary proof. Just as the spread of television is only part of the story of how politics changed in the middle of the last century, Facebook is part of a story involving a global refugee crisis, a deep and world-altering recession, and much else besides. But it is still an essential part of the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	What troubles me is that one of my conclusions of my post-2016 post-mortem was that I had underestimated Donald Trump because, instead of critically examining the question “can Donald Trump win the 2016 presidential election?” I was critically examining people whose reasoning was “I didn’t like Brexit, I didn’t like Corbyn, and I’m not going to like Trump so that will happen too”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I clearly haven’t done a good enough job of actually &lt;em&gt;learning &lt;/em&gt;from this particular mistake. Something to watch out for in 2019 is not just what I get wrong, but how much I am merely repeating the same mistakes in a different fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--

	The highlights from this year’s New Statesman books coverage include some large and complicated lives, a deep dive into the politics of grime, a look at the meaning of “auto-fiction” and an untangling of the legacy of the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/2018/11/eternal-boy-kenneth-grahame-biography-matthew-dennison-wind-willows&quot;&gt;Dark-hearted dreamer: Lyndall Gordon on the double life of Kenneth Grahame&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In Kenneth Grahame’s children’s classic, &lt;em&gt;The Wind in the Willows&lt;/em&gt;, Ratty, the Water Rat, shuns the Wide World beyond the Wild Wood. He instructs his friend Mole that anyone with sense would not go there. But Grahame himself did go there, and more: he shaped himself to the Wide World, as a new biography by Matthew Dennison relates. Contemporary opinion saw Grahame as “a man’s man”. Yet Dennison tells the story of a boy so damaged by a loveless upbringing as to be incapable of sustained adult attachment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/books/2018/03/dostoevsky-s-crime-and-punishment-refashioned-idea-what-novel-could-be&quot;&gt;How Dostoevsky’s Crime and Punishment refashioned the idea of what a novel could be&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Published a little over 150 years ago, Dostoevsky’s &lt;em&gt;Crime and Punishment&lt;/em&gt; is a testament to his openness or resourcefulness, writes Leo Robson – and also a reflection of just what a long and traumatic journey he had taken to composing his first great novel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/books/2018/07/cormac-mccarthy-s-existential-westerns&quot;&gt;Rachel Kushner on Cormac McCarthy’s existential westerns &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The reader, like the cowboys in the books, will eventually acclimate to the landscape as a totalising reality, where meditation and resistance are two components of one reality, a destiny of wandering the borderlands of the US and Mexico in the postwar 20th century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/Grime-Books-Inner-City-Pressure-Dan-Hancox-%20Kids-%20Inside-Story-Global-Takeover-DJ-Target-review&quot;&gt;How grime became king by K Biswas&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In his book on grime music, Dan Hancox explains that a distinct “Britishness” derives from the nation’s multicultural diasporas “intermingling with working-class slang and culture, rubbing up against each other” – their scenes driven by second- and third-generation migrant youth invested in occupying cultural spaces, having been shut out of political ones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/books/2018/02/unenlightened-thinking-steven-pinker-s-embarrassing-new-book-feeble-sermon&quot;&gt;Unenlightened thinking: John Gray on Steven Pinker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	“For Pinker there are no bad Enlightenment ideas,” writes John Gray. “One of the features of the comic-book history of the Enlightenment he presents is that it is innocent of all evil. Accordingly, when despots such as Lenin repeatedly asserted that they engaged in mass killing in order to realise an Enlightenment project – in Lenin’s case, a more far-reaching version of the Jacobin project of re-educating society by the methodical use of terror – they must have been deluded or lying.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/books/2018/04/jacqueline-rose-s-book-offers-clear-sighted-analysis-what-it-means-be-mother&quot;&gt;The womb as battlefield: Suzanne Moore on &lt;em&gt;Mothers&lt;/em&gt; by Jacqueline Rose&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	“I reacted to this book as a breeder and a reader. Actually, Rose’s book tore me apart, reminding me of things I would rather forget. Motherhood is not easy. It does not get easier, though I pay lip service to the old lie that it does.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/2018/09/I-Am-Dynamite-Friedrich-Nietzsche-biography-Sue-Prideaux-review&quot;&gt;The agony and the destiny: Ray Monk on the life of Nietzsche&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In the years immediately before, during and just after the Second World War, Nietzsche’s reputation in the English-speaking world was at its lowest, largely owing to the fact that his work had been appropriated by the Nazis. It has taken a while, but Nietzsche’s reputation as a philosopher has been fully restored. The story of his life is by turns inspiring, poignant and dispiriting, and it has never been better told than in this riveting book by Sue Prideaux, writes Ray Monk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/rebel-girls-nasty-badass-women-history-feminist-books-publishing-trend-review&quot;&gt;Anna Leszkiewicz: Why is publishing suddenly obsessed with “rebel” women?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Individually, these books are on a harmless mission to engage even the most politically apathetic woman with concepts of feminism. Yet collectively, a patronising scene emerges. The tone is mainly uncritical. The same terms pop up again and again – the books are a “love letter” to or a “celebration” of women who are “heroic”, “role models”, and most of all, always “inspirational”. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/2018/11/heart-history-sandeep-jauhar-nine-pints-blood-rose-george-book-review&quot;&gt;Henry Marsh on the history of the heart&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The story of cardiology is one of dramatic technological progress and yet Sandeep Jauhar, author of &lt;em&gt;Heart: A History&lt;/em&gt;, concludes that: “We have moved away from the emotional heart to a narrow focus on the biomechanical pump”, and this, he tells us, has hurt patients. The great American cardiologist Bernard Lown tells many stories of his patients who seemed to be dying from heart failure but were revived by being given hope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/books/2018/09/Domina-The-Women-Who-Made-Imperial-Rome-Guy-Bedoyere-review&quot;&gt;Matrons and murderers: Lucy Hughes Hallett on the women who made Rome&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As individuals the women of the imperial family had no direct power, but as matriarchs, and most particularly as mothers, they could aspire to influence. Over and over again, though, they found that chance, or the ingratitude of the sons for whom they had schemed and, in some cases, murdered, thwarted their hopes of queen-motherly happiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/2018/08/adam-tooze-crashed-decade-financial-crisis-review&quot;&gt;The post-crash world: Aditya Chakrabortty on how the 2008 crisis led to our current age of extremes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Hardly anybody saw it coming: not the financiers, not the economists, and certainly not the inflation-hawks, nor the rest of the political classes. Yet an event so widely unforeseen was almost immediately interpreted in a thousand different ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/books/2018/08/after-autofiction&quot;&gt;After autofiction: Chris Power on Rachel Cusk and Karl Ove Knausgaard&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Rachel Cusk and Karl Ove Knausgaard embarked on works blurring the boundaries between fiction and autobiography. Now the two series have come to an end, did they find the freedom they craved? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/books/2018/08/how-second-world-war-made-britain-multicultural&quot;&gt;David Olusoga: how the Second World War made Britain multicultural&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	“Pre-war Britain was far from ethnically or racially homogeneous,” Olusoga writes, reviewing Wendy Webster’s &lt;em&gt;Mixing It&lt;/em&gt;. “But the exigencies of total war meant that the remote village pubs of rural Somerset became the favoured hang-outs of African-American GIs and that men from British Honduras (modern Belize) found themselves working as lumberjacks in remote parts of Scotland, living alongside people who had never seen black men.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/books/2018/07/annie-ernaux-memoir-the-years-review-french&quot;&gt;Margaret Drabble on how Annie Ernaux reinvented the memoir&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Ernaux has inherited Simone de Beauvoir’s role of chronicler to a generation, and her agenda is feminist. Her latest work,&lt;em&gt; The Years&lt;/em&gt;, already a best-seller in France, is a collective memoir: a powerful attempt to grasp history through “material” memory, and to describe the evolution of attitudes, events, and, as importantly, things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/books/2018/08/master-his-universe-warnings-jrr-tolkien-s-novels&quot;&gt;Rowan Williams on why we should take JRR Tolkien seriously&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	“&lt;em&gt;The Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt; is ultimately a fiction about how desire for power – the kind of power that will make us safe, reverse injustices and avenge defeats – is a dream that can devour even the most decent.” In our current climate of political insanities and fascistic fantasies, Rowan Williams argues that it is a good time to dust off Tolkien’s legacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/books/2018/07/john-edgar-wideman-voice-america-s-great-divide&quot;&gt;Erica Wagner on John Edgar Wideman and the bitter legacy of American slavery&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Wideman’s younger brother Robert was sentenced to life without parole in 1976 for his participation in a murder; his nephew was murdered, and his own son stabbed a man to death at the age of 16 and is still in prison, more than 30 years later. As his new collection of stories is published, Erica Wagner looks at a life and a body of work that is haunted by sorrow, and by the legacy of slavery and the war that tore apart the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/2018/05/michael-jackson-margo-jefferson-childhood-sexual-abuse-allegations&quot;&gt;Lost boy: the meanings and motivations of Michael Jackson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Ten years after the King of Pop’s death, Tom Gatti revisits Margo Jefferson’s &lt;em&gt;On Michael Jackson.&lt;/em&gt; “Like a daemon in Philip Pullman’s &lt;em&gt;Northern Lights&lt;/em&gt;, a familiar whose form remains unfixed until its owner hits puberty, Jackson was in a state of constant transformation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/books/2018/10/On-Future-Prospects-Humanity-Martin-Rees-Review&quot;&gt;Apocalypse soon: Anjana Ahuja on visions of the end of the world&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In &lt;em&gt;On The Future: Prospects for Humanity&lt;/em&gt;, Martin Rees, the Astronomer Royal, serves an updated menu of the ways in which we might, accidentally or not, find ourselves obliterated. Climate change, nuclear war or an asteroid strike could wipe out the planet as a viable habitat. An overpopulated world – there are projected to be nine billion citizens by 2050 – offers handsome prospects for starvation and pandemic disease. In a highly connected world run by machines, the consequences of cyber-attacks can cascade globally. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;
	The &lt;em&gt;New Statesman &lt;/em&gt;delivered an eclectic mix of in-depth coverage throughout 2018, covering everything from the evolution of the Corbyn project to an in-depth look at our guts. Here&#039;s a selection of some of the &lt;em&gt;New Statesman’s&lt;/em&gt; top long reads over the last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2018/01/boomers-vs-millennials-defining-schism-uk-politics&quot;&gt;Boomers vs millennials: the defining schism in UK politics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	From housing to Brexit to wages, the fault lines underlying Britain in 2018 seem more numerous than ever. Underpinning it all is a yawning gap between the experiences and expectations of those born in the years after the Second World War, and the lives of those entering adulthood in the 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century. George Eaton explores the factors and circumstances that has pitted the UK’s generations against each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/2018/02/truly-remember-holocaust-we-must-stay-alert-prejudice&quot;&gt;To truly remember the Holocaust, we must stay alert to prejudice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Arguments over the Labour Party’s handling of anti-Semitism dominated much of the summer. Here, novelist Howard Jacobson examines the wider context in which hatred of Jews lives on long after the Holocaust, and how honouring the past requires us to challenge prejudice in the present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/art-design/2018/03/sex-and-death-classical-world&quot;&gt;Sex and death in the classical world&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Historian and broadcaster Mary Beard unearths what the art of the Romans and Greeks tells us about how they lived, died and loved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2018/04/corbyn-s-capital-story-how-london-became-labour-city&quot;&gt;Corbyn&#039;s capital: the story of how London became a Labour city&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Despite its status as the UK’s richest city, London has steadily become a Labour stronghold. In 2017 it came out strongly for the party’s most radical leader in a generation with even leafy Kensington retuning a Labour MP. George Eaton lays out shifts that have turned the nation’s capital away from the Tories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/world/asia/2018/06/keeping-kims-north-korea-s-communist-monarchy&quot;&gt;Keeping up with the Kims: North Korea’s communist monarchy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Under the rule of the Kim dynasty, North Korea has remained both one of the world’s most closed societies and a constant concern for the rest of the world. Gavin Jacobson charts how one family has maintained an iron grip from the end of the Korean War to the present day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/world/middle-east/2018/06/close-encounter-british-isis-jihadis&quot;&gt;A close encounter with British Isis jihadis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Anthony Loyd recounts his meeting with Alexanda Kotey and El Shafee Elsheikh, the Isis executioners who were part of the infamous “Beatles” who murdered journalist James Foley and others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/science-tech/internet/2018/07/death-don-draper&quot;&gt;The death of Don Draper&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Advertising has transformed from the creative industry lionised in &lt;em&gt;Mad Men&lt;/em&gt; into a data-driven business tailored by algorithms and delivered over the web. Ian Leslie unpicks its implications not just for consumers, but democracy itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2018/07/blackburn-town-stopped-working&quot;&gt;Jeremy Seabrook: Blackburn, the town that stopped working&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In 1971 Jeremy Seabrook recorded a series of programmes for the BBC about Blackburn and its place at the forefront of deindustrialisation. Fifty years later he returns to find a city still struggling to adapt to wide-ranging economic and cultural change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/education/2018/07/how-teach-happiness&quot;&gt;How to teach happiness&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Psychologist Laurie Santos has designed an experimental new course on how to be happy for students at Yale University. Sophie McBain asks, can you really learn how to feel better?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/2018/07/england-rising&quot;&gt;England rising&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Jason Cowley explores how a summer of footballing success helped reawaken a sense of progressive English nationalism that had long lain dormant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/world/europe/2018/10/great-schism-could-pull-eu-apart&quot;&gt;The great schism that could pull the EU apart&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The forces pulling Europe apart are bigger than Brexit, with liberalism’s defenders in the west and north of the union increasingly pitted against more authoritarian forces in its south and east. Timothy Lees lays out the central challenge threatening unity on the continent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2018/08/how-britain-political-conversation-turned-toxic&quot;&gt;How Britain&#039;s political conversation turned toxic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A combination of political divides, public disillusionment, and digital platforms has poisoned discourse, turning important debates into vicious and often personal attacks. Helen Lewis looks at how we got here, and what, if anything, we can do about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/world/europe/2018/10/did-end-great-war-come-too-soon&quot;&gt;Did the end of the Great War come too soon?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	100 years after the end of World War One, David Reynolds asks how the 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century might have been different if Armistice Day had come in 1919.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/books/2018/10/why-novel-matters-age-anger&quot;&gt;Elif Shafak: Why the novel matters in the age of anger&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In the 2018 &lt;em&gt;New Statesman&lt;/em&gt;/Goldsmiths Prize lecture, Elif Shafak explains why – in a world ruled by fear and division – novelists no longer have the luxury of being apolitical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2018/09/corbynism-20-radical-ideas-shaping-labour-s-future&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corbynism&lt;/strong&gt; 2.0: the radical ideas shaping Labour’s future&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	George Eaton charts the evolution of Labour’s policy programme from the social democratic traditions under which it fought the 2017 general election to a new, more radical and forward thinking platform.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/health/2018/10/what-gut-knows&quot;&gt;What the gut knows&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Naomi Alderman explores the visceral relationship between our digestive systems and our minds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2018/11/how-right-s-brexit-dream-died&quot;&gt;How the right&#039;s Brexit dream died&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The wrangling over Theresa May’s Brexit deal continues but the hopes of its free market backers are increasingly receding. George Eaton details how their plans to impose a new economic model on the turned to dust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/energy/2018/12/amateur-scientists-tackling-global-energy-crisis&quot;&gt;The amateur scientists tackling the global energy crisis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Will Dunn meets the dedicated band of amateurs pursuing the dream of nuclear fusion.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The liberal youth flee Thanet – but at Christmas we are inevitably drawn back</title>

	There’s still something addictive about the area. I’ve been going to Broadstairs arcades since I was ten and still haven’t won on the crane machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;
	It’s Christmas, which means that lots of people from small towns and villages across the country will be heading home to the places that their city friends forget exist. Trading the lively lights of London – it’s usually London – for the countryside, seaside or whatever other sort of sticks, the pilgrimage back to where you’re from is usually a mixed bag. It’s a weird balancing act between the warmth of nostalgia and the reminders of why you left.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For me, that comes on the Isle of Thanet, which comprises the seaside towns of Ramsgate, Margate and Broadstairs, as well as several smaller villages, and is Kent’s most easterly point. It was formerly separated from the main land by the 600m-wide Wantsum Channel, but over the course of the last millennium the channel became filled up with sediment from the River Stour and the shingle that was collected along its coast helped to attach Thanet to the rest of England. The name, though, has stuck. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	And there’s something so fitting about it. Thanet has an island mentality: fiercely proud and protective of its local culture and history, while simultaneously suspicious of the world beyond its borders. Multiple generations of Thanesian families attend the same schools, drink in the same pubs and live in the same neighbourhoods as their parents. Those who do leave the Isle – for work or university – rarely venture very far, visit regularly, and often come back to settle down in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Though aspects of the Isle represent the quintessence of Kent – grammar schools, leafy suburbs and easy commutability to London– Thanet has enough patches of poverty and teen pregnancies to qualify as a Home Counties black sheep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Isle’s claims to fame, or infamy, depending on your disposition, include: Charles Dickens writing his novel &lt;em&gt;David Copperfield &lt;/em&gt;while holidaying in Broadstairs, Margate artist Tracy Emin making the shortlist for the Turner Prize, Margate providing the setting for an episode of &lt;em&gt;Only Fools and Horses&lt;/em&gt;, former prime minister Sir Edward Heath attending Chatham House Grammar School in Ramsgate, and former Ukip leader Nigel Farage trying, and failing, to be elected as South Thanet’s member of parliament twice. In 2017, Ramsgate’s old Royal Victoria Pavilion casino was converted into the biggest Wetherspoon pub in the country, and by extension, the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Growing up on the Isle, my own feelings towards Thanet went through phases. I loved the beaches, parks and promenades. I loved the enduring pride and presence of local businesses – my first part-time job was at the butcher J.C. Rook and Son’s – and I was lucky enough to go to a very well-run school in Chatham House, which gave me opportunities I probably wouldn’t have got elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But for all those perks, Thanet came with caveats too. The Isle, which has an overwhelmingly white-British population, is nonetheless convinced that immigrants are taking over and that political correctness has gone too far. As an ethnic minority from Thanet, let me say that nothing stings quite like being told to “go home” when you already are. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	That’s not to say that everyone from Thanet is a racist, but is to say that Thanet is home to a lot of racists, who take tabloid headlines at face value, and treat immigrants as a convenient scapegoat for the area’s wider problems. Margate’s Cliftonville neighbourhood, one pub pundit told me during my last visit home, is a “no-go zone” due to its large number of refugees. It’s really not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Thanet’s more liberal-minded youth – who do exist – tend to flee to the city if they get chance, but even then there’s a strange magnetism that keeps us going back. I have plenty of gripes about the Isle, yet I can’t imagine going more than a few months without visiting. Family ties play a big part in that, of course, but even independent of those, there’s still something addictive about the area. I’ve been going to Broadstairs arcades since I was ten and still haven’t won on the crane machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When I was in sixth form, first getting to grips with Thanet’s spectacularly poor nightlife, which is characterised by pubs which think turning the volume up on their music makes them clubs, or a few cans down one of the bays, I remember making plans with my friends to leave this all behind us. But none of us have, and over the Christmas break, we’ll be back on the same beaches, in the same bars, ruing how the mega Spoons has ruined Ramsgate harbour trade, most likely before heading to the mega Spoons ourselves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Isle of Thanet is not, as the &lt;em&gt;Daily Telegraph &lt;/em&gt;once described it, “The Kent Riviera”. It’s not an island, either, but the beaches are lovely, and it is home.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--

	Donald Trump, the wasteman, is somehow still President.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The far right, more emboldened and barbaric by the day, parade streets throughout the western world. Immoral arms dealing, sinister geopolitics and despotism fuel bloody wars and conflict. Short of a holistic upheaval away from fossil capitalism and destructive industries within the next dozen years, climate catastrophe will ensue. And then, of course, there’s Brexit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Processing the state of our country and the state of our planet, constantly sends chills down my spine, and I know I’m not alone in that regard. We are often faced with difficult emotions – of anger, fear and dread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Coming to the end of 2018, however, my time as Lord Mayor of Sheffield has taught me two invaluable lessons: that there is always hope even in the obscurest of places, and that the need for compassion in the way we do politics, and do life, has never been greater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Inspired by the simple philosophy of “doing things differently” I have attempted to use my platform to celebrate Sheffield and draw awareness to important causes, and to bring people together in a world that’s trying to drive us apart. And one of the ways I have tried to do that is through my t-shirts. Here are some of the slogans I’ll remember:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	June 2018: “DONALD TRUMP IS A WASTEMAN”&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
		I Magid Magid, Lord Mayor &amp;amp; first citizen of this city hereby declare that not only is Donald J Trump (&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@realDonaldTrump&lt;/a&gt;) a WASTEMAN, but he is also henceforth banned from the great city of Sheffield!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;		I further declare July 13th to be Mexico Solidarity Day! &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/qYehdHYDEt&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/qYehdHYDEt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	— MΛG!D (@MagicMagid) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/MagicMagid/status/1014494400532148225?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;July 4, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	In this current political climate, the last thing we need is a world leader like Donald J Trump stoking divisions between communities while scapegoating minorities. I am proud to be the Lord Mayor of Sheffield, the UK’s first city of sanctuary for migrants, asylum seekers and refugees. We don’t tolerate racism and xenophobia, and we not only celebrate all our differences but unite on the things we have in common. When the government rolled out the red carpet for Trump, it was left to us, the people, to take a stand. I for one could not allow us to legitimise everything he stood for. So I decided to send him and others a strong message and brand him a WASTEMAN!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
	September 2018: “ALWAYS HAVE EACH OTHERS BACKS. ALWAYS!”&lt;/h4&gt;

	I’m no suicide or mental health expert, nor am I trying to be. But what I do know is that more than 6,000 people die by suicide every year in the UK. We need to break the silence and have each other’s backs, because we are sadly living in a society where the stigma keeps many from seeking help and treatment, and stops others from even talking about it, even to their nearest and dearest. On World Suicide Prevention Day, I was proud to launch a UK-wide suicide prevention charter signed by over one hundred organisations, urging them to break the silence, create, evolve and enhance policies to support mental wellbeing and develop their understanding of the risk factors around suicide. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.magicmagid.com/suicideprevention/&quot;&gt;More information can be found here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

		Boris Johnson isn’t funny, Boris isn’t harmless. Boris is a posh-speaking, fancily-dressed, racist mophead imbecile. Him being passively accepted as a benign and reasonable potential leader of this country, genuinely makes me sick! &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/RtHonBigot?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#RtHonBigot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/BHM2018?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#BHM2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/CPC18?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#CPC18&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/UFheIT7nXU&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/UFheIT7nXU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Boris Johnson is a posh-speaking, fancily-dressed, racist, mophead, Islamophobic imbecile. The idea of passively accepting him as a reasonable potential leader of this country genuinely makes me sick. As the architects of the racist hostile environment policy met and squabbled at their party conference in October, I wanted to give them a simple message – that racism and intolerance will be vanquished. We have more in common, more to share, we depend on one another, and we work best when we are looking out for one another. I’m confident that we as a country are not capable of making such a mistake as placing power and our future in the hands of Bigot Boris.&lt;/p&gt;

	It is not politicians in comfy chairs, but working people who are compelled to make the ultimate sacrifice. Today, innocent civilians are killed by bombs with British labels in Yemen and elsewhere. With it being the centenary of the ending of WW1 (the war to end all wars) this year, it was important to me to use my platform to speak on the matter. On Remembrance Sunday 2018, as well as laying both a white-poppy wreath and a red one, I chose to only wear a white poppy. &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;//www.instagram.com/embed.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Action or extinction – it’s that simple. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/08/global-warming-must-not-exceed-15c-warns-landmark-un-report&quot;&gt;Our world’s best scientists have confirmed we have 12 short years&lt;/a&gt; to prevent the exponential acceleration of catastrophic climate change. Some have said that I’m over-exaggerating, but I fear we have genuinely driven the Earth to the edge of its capacity to harbour life. When world leaders met in Poland debating the specifics of the Paris Agreement, I wanted to make it clear that politicians cannot ignore their historic responsibility. Their cowardice in the face of corporations has to end. If we act now, if we act from this Christmas, then there is a glimmer of hope. If we do not, the consequences will be apocalyptic for civilization and the natural world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Some people have criticised the way I have used my platform, but in general, the reception – whether on social media, walking through the streets of Sheffield, or attending events around the country and in Europe – has been overwhelmingly positive and empowering. The status quo has left the majority tired, in despair and in want of something new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The truth is, the political establishment are not representative of our society. The squat, for me, has become a symbol of defiance. It’s up to us to create our own traditions, not conform to standards created by others for themselves and those they wish to maintain power over. We must get off our high horses, widen engagement and make politics fit for the 21st century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Every single one of us has a circle – some form of platform, some degree of influence. Speaking truth to power, acting according to our capability and opportunity, whatever that may be, is our collective responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It’s not easy. I keep a hate-box in the corner of my parlour, filled with the dozens of abusive and hateful letters awaiting me at the Town Hall on a regular basis. And the social media bullying culture leaves me, like many people, exhausted most nights of the week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	We all need coping mechanisms, to see the hope and feel the compassion, to stop us from going numb. I love a good dessert to keep me going – some steaming-hot flapjack and custard and I’m raring to go (though my recent visit to the dentist showed it isn’t without consequence).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Let’s be clear, this past year has shown people have recognised that things cannot stay as they are any longer. From this Christmas, we everyday folk must fill the political elite’s present vacuum of ideas with our progressive plans and principled solutions, for a fairer, more equal society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The proof is in the sticky toffee pudding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;Magid Magid is Lord Mayor of Sheffield and a Green party councillor. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Trump has decided to own this government shutdown. Here’s why that will backfire</title>

	In a poll, two-thirds of independent voters said they don’t believe that a border wall is important enough to warrant a shutdown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;
	It is Christmas in America and the government is shut down, after President Donald Trump forced a showdown with Democrats over funding for his quixotic border wall – you remember, the one he kept saying on the campaign trail would be paid for by Mexico. (It is redundant to say these days that the president was lying, of course. Bears defecate in forests, popes practice Catholicism, Trump lies.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The US government is closed for business. Civil service offices are shuttered. Federal workers – more than a million of them – will not receive their paychecks before the holidays. National parks are closed. Customs and immigration officials will continue to man their posts, but without pay. Workers at the Department of Housing and Urban Development are furloughed, delaying the processing of home loans and grants. Workers at the Internal Revenue Service are on unpaid leave, meaning that tax queries will go unanswered. The Food and Drug Administration has stopped its inspections. (The Pentagon and the Department of Education are not affected).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	So far it has played out like other previous government shutdowns, except in a mirror-world way – usually both sides desperately try to avoid owning a shutdown, preferring to blame the other side; Trump’s approach has been the exact opposite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This week, he invited Democratic leaders to a meeting at the White House to negotiate. At issue was the $5bn Trump is demanding for his largest folly: his border wall, a vastly expensive boondoggle designed purely for political optics. (In fact, the vast majority of illegal immigration in the US happens by plane, with people arriving on legal visas and then overstaying them once they expire).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When House speaker-designate Nancy Pelosi and Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer arrived, however, instead of the closed-door meeting they expected, they found themselves unwilling participants in a weird &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-nancy-pelosi-chuck-schumer-meeting-white-house-oval-office-democrats-government-shut-down-us-a8678426.html&quot;&gt;theatrical facsimile of a negotiation&lt;/a&gt;, in full view of television cameras.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If that was meant to be an intimidation tactic by Trump, it backfired severely. Pelosi kept asking if he wanted to negotiate in private; Trump appeared to think that this meant they were ashamed of what they wanted to propose, but the reality is quite the opposite: in deference to accepted norms, as Pelosi said at one point: “I don’t want to publicly contradict you” on the numbers he was quoting – numbers that bore little or no relation to reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Trump at first responded with shock when Pelosi framed the shutdown as the “Trump shutdown”, but later decided that he would own the phrase. Schumer and Pelosi could hardly contain their glee: Trump had decided, voluntarily, to take the blame for the thing that you &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; blame the other side for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It is hard to see what his game is here. It could be sheer obstinacy: Trump will double down on any position he finds himself in, especially when challenged. If he accidentally said the sky was green, he’d then argue to the death that it is so; if you point to the sky and say that it is manifestly blue, he’d call you “fake news.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But in the case of a government shutdown, it is possible that Trump has underestimated the scale of anger generated by forcing people to go without US federal services over Christmas, as well as the federal workers themselves going home to their families for the holidays without their pay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Trump is counting on the fact that the Democrats’ will object to the funding of his border wall – funding that, as incoming progressive Democrat rising star rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Ocasio2018/status/1076167537447059459&quot;&gt;pointed out on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, could be used for real work that would have a real impact on people’s lives. “For the wall’s $5.7 billion, every child in America could have access to Universal Pre-K,” she wrote. “Yet when we propose the SAME $, we’re told Universal Edu is a ‘fantasy’ &amp;amp; asked ‘how are you going to pay for it’ … Education is an investment in society that yields returns. Walls are waste.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Trump has also clearly underestimated Nancy Pelosi, who is ably outmanoeuvring him in terms of public perception, coming across as reasonable and sensible compared to Trump’s childish and clumsy obstreperousness. She and Schumer have successfully managed to brand it as a “Trump shutdown”, without even any opposition from the president.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	“Democrats have offered Republicans multiple proposals to keep the government open, including one that already passed the Senate unanimously, &amp;amp; all of which include funding for strong, sensible, &amp;amp; effective border security – not the president&#039;s ineffective and expensive wall,” she &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/NancyPelosi/status/1076488648353300481&quot;&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Even Republicans have responded with disappointment at the president’s intransigence. “This is a made up fight so the president can look like he&#039;s fighting and winning,” senator Bob Corker, who is retiring at the end of this year, said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	He’s not wrong. This shutdown is clearly another Trump stunt – likely fuelled by a desire to distract from his more pressing problems, like the circling Mueller investigation and the chaos at the Department of Defense which followed the shock announcement last week that US troops would be withdrawing from Syria and which precipitated the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/world/north-america/2018/12/jim-mattis-was-last-general-american-era&quot;&gt;resignation of secretary of defense Jim Mattis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Trump may be playing to his base, but he seems to have miscalculated this time. A poll from last week by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politico.com/story/2018/12/19/poll-voters-would-blame-trump-gop-for-shutdown-1068673&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Politico/Morning Consult&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; showed that 55 per cent of voters don’t consider a border wall important enough to shut the government down over. Among GOP voters, 60 per cent believe it is important enough to shut down the government – but independents are against it more than two to one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Since Trump has been so keen to take ownership of the shutdown, he may find it difficult to spread the blame around once public anger starts to increase. It’s like he’s playing a game of chicken – with himself.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--

    <title>From Drop Dead Gorgeous to Dumplin’: reclaiming beauty pageants on screen</title>
    <link>https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/film/2018/12/drop-dead-gorgeous-dumplin-reclaiming-beauty-pageants-screen</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-subheadline field-type-text-long field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;
	All these dramas, from &lt;em&gt;Little Miss Sunshine&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;Miss Congeniality&lt;/em&gt;, grapple with a central question – are beauty pageants anti-feminist?&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-node-image field-type-image field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;noscript class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoints=&quot;300 768 1024&quot; data-adaptive-image-300-img=&quot;&amp;lt;img class=&amp;quot;adaptive-image&amp;quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&amp;quot;300&amp;quot; typeof=&amp;quot;foaf:Image&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/lead_image/public/Longreads_2018/12/pageant.png?itok=qFUrFSF7&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&quot; data-adaptive-image-768-img=&quot;&amp;lt;img class=&amp;quot;adaptive-image&amp;quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&amp;quot;768&amp;quot; typeof=&amp;quot;foaf:Image&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/lead_image/public/Longreads_2018/12/pageant.png?itok=qFUrFSF7&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&quot; data-adaptive-image-1024-img=&quot;&amp;lt;img class=&amp;quot;adaptive-image&amp;quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&amp;quot;1024&amp;quot; typeof=&amp;quot;foaf:Image&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/lead_image/public/Longreads_2018/12/pageant.png?itok=qFUrFSF7&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&quot; data-adaptive-image-max-img=&quot;&amp;lt;img class=&amp;quot;adaptive-image&amp;quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&amp;quot;max&amp;quot; typeof=&amp;quot;foaf:Image&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/lead_image/public/Longreads_2018/12/pageant.png?itok=qFUrFSF7&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&quot;&gt;&lt;img typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/Longreads_2018/12/pageant.png?itok=ts-Ej-VI&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;
	In an unglamorous town in the USA, there is an unconventional, tomboyish girl who doesn’t quite fit in. Perhaps her mother – beautiful and feminine – is a former beauty pageant queen. Perhaps her friends at school are contestants, or perhaps ambition leads her there – the promise of scholarship funds or career advancement. Either way, this girl who doesn’t fit in finds herself thrust into an airless room thick with the mists of hairspray, where dark looks are exchanged over newly glossed lips, the sound of snapping Spanx bouncing around the walls. There she is, Miss Almost America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	She was there in Mount Rose, Minnesota for the town’s American Teen Princess Pageant in &lt;em&gt;Drop Dead Gorgeous&lt;/em&gt; (1999). She was all grown up and smuggling her way in to San Antonio, Texas for the 75&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Miss United States beauty pageant in &lt;em&gt;Miss Congeniality&lt;/em&gt; (2000). She was a little girl travelling all the way from Albuquerque, New Mexico to Redondo Beach, California for the eponymous children’s pageant in &lt;em&gt;Little Miss Sunshine&lt;/em&gt; (2006). She was an outsider begrudgingly competing in Bodeen, Texas’s Miss Blue Bonnet Pageant in &lt;em&gt;Whip It&lt;/em&gt; (2009).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In 2018, she reappears three times. In Netflix’s &lt;em&gt;Insatiable&lt;/em&gt; as the once-fat, now-skinny Patty (Debby Ryan) from Masonville, Georgia, competing in a number of ludicrously named pageants (Miss Bareback Buckaroo, Miss Magic Jesus) for some vague “revenge” on her former bullies. In Facebook Watch’&lt;em&gt;s Queen America&lt;/em&gt; she is the hapless, clumsy Samantha of Tulsa, Oklahoma, the surprise winner-by-default of the Miss Oklahoma Starred and Striped US Beauty Pageant being whipped into shape for Miss America by her ruthless coach, Vicki (Catherine Zeta-Jones). And in Netflix’s feature film &lt;em&gt;Dumplin’&lt;/em&gt;, she is Willowdean Dickson (Danielle McDonald) of Clover City, Texas; a fat, Dolly Parton-obsessed teenager who enters the Miss Teen Blue Bonnet Pageant as a protest against her pageant-winning mother (Jennifer Aniston).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This is unconventionality as convention. Though they vary significantly in quality (&lt;em&gt;Dumplin’&lt;/em&gt; is warm and generous, &lt;em&gt;Queen America &lt;/em&gt;mediocre, and &lt;em&gt;Insatiable&lt;/em&gt; borderline unwatchable), there are broad overlaps between each drama. Two make their leads obsessive over-relatable icons of eccentric femininity (Dolly Parton in &lt;em&gt;Dumplin’&lt;/em&gt;, Drew Barrymore in &lt;em&gt;Insatiable&lt;/em&gt;); and two set the scene with shots of their protagonists driving around their respective small towns listening to Dolly Parton’s “9 to 5”. All three explore pageants as the place where the standards of womanhood are set, as the ultimate hostile environment for fat girls, and as a financial opportunity for blue-collar families. All three know, like their predecessors, that the beauty pageant is the place where the capitalist fantasy of the American dream and the ugly duckling fairytale collide – you can be anyone, from anywhere, and become somebody special, glamorous, and beautiful. And all three, also like their predecessors, grapple with a central question – are beauty pageants anti-feminist?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;rtecenter&quot;&gt;
	&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;media-image attr__typeof__foaf:Image img__fid__100802 img__view_mode__media_large attr__format__media_large&quot; height=&quot;532&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/3_3.jpg?itok=7EYVBuRW&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Credit: Drop Dead Gorgeous&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
		Beauty pageant films are in part popular because of their intrinsically cinematic setting. A teenager-filled institution fraught with cliques and rivalries; a direct window into the traditions and community of a small-town setting; framing a centre stage, lights dimmed in preparation for stories of new-found confidence and discovered talents. But unlike their Hollywood cousins – films and TV shows about prom nights, talent shows, battles of the bands, dance-offs and cheerleading competitions – beauty pageant films often more directly discuss questions about femininity, womanhood, and feminism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Beauty pageants have always been a contested space in feminist discourse. As Kimberly A Hamlin explains in her essay “Bathing suits and backlash: The first Miss America pageants 1921-1927”, American beauty pageants have their roots in the explicitly feminist suffragist parades of the 1910s. Suffragettes felt that parades and pageants were crucial to gaining support for their cause. Campaigners would dress up as an array of important women from history – be it Joan of Arc or Florence Nightingale. The iconic white sashes of modern pageants are relations of the sashes worn by suffragettes – sometimes emblazoned “Votes for Women”, sometimes bearing the names of the US states that had already granted women the vote. Miss America was founded in 1921, the year after the 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; amendment was passed allowing women to vote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It seems difficult to imagine pageants, which foster some of our most rigid and oppressive beauty standards, as in any way related to an enfranchising feminist project. But defenders of pageants, fictional and real, counter criticisms with arguments that pageants are, in their own way, “empowering” women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	“Do you think that most people would say that teenage beauty pageants are a good idea?” asks a voice from behind the camera in 1999’s cult satire &lt;em&gt;Drop Dead Gorgeous&lt;/em&gt;. “Oh, yah, sure,” replies Gladys Leeman (Kirstie Alley), pageant organiser and former beauty queen, in her sarcastic, tense Minnesotan voice. “I know what some of your big city, no bra-wearin’ hairy-legged women’s libbers say. Pageants are &lt;em&gt;old-fashioned&lt;/em&gt; and, uh, and &lt;em&gt;demeaning&lt;/em&gt; to the girls.” She barely dignifies the accusations with a response. “For one thing, y’know, we’re God-fearin’ folk. Every last one of us.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;Miss Congeniality&lt;/em&gt;’s equivalent role, another pageant organiser and former beauty queen, Kathy Morningside (Candice Bergen), is similarly vitriolic. “I’ve been fighting all my life against your type. The ones who think we’re just a bunch of worthless airheads. You know who I mean. Feminists, intellectuals… ugly women. But I refuse to give in to their cynicism. That’s why I have dedicated my entire life to this scholarship programme.” &lt;em&gt;Dumplin&lt;/em&gt;’s pageant organiser and former beauty queen, Jennifer Aniston’s Rosie, is less extreme, demurring that “Not everybody understands what these pageants are all about.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One character, early on in &lt;em&gt;Dumplin’&lt;/em&gt;, describes pageants as institutions of “the oppressive heteropatriarchy unconsciously internalised by the female psyche”; Gracie in &lt;em&gt;Miss Congeniality &lt;/em&gt;balks, “It’s like feminism never even happened. Any woman that does this is catering to misogynistic Neanderthal mentality.” These are the polarised views that must be reconciled or chosen between by the time the credits roll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;rtecenter&quot;&gt;
	&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;media-image attr__typeof__foaf:Image img__fid__100800 img__view_mode__media_large attr__format__media_large&quot; height=&quot;533&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/olive.jpg?itok=elmvWkpv&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Credit: Little Miss Sunshine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
		Almost every beauty pageant film makes unavoidably clear that pageants are one big gender performance – requiring contestants to mimic long-standing stereotypes of femininity. This is not limited to the obligatory makeover sequence every dramatisation of pageants contains, but extends into everything from expressions, mannerisms and emotions (freely flowing tears of shock and gratitude) to character and beliefs (peace-loving, selfless, warm). In 2018, our leads are coached into becoming perfect pageant queens by another kind of gender performer – drag queens. The implication is that queer people, particularly those emulating, exaggerating or subverting femininity on stage, have a particular insight about gendered codes of behaviour, and self-acceptance, and can pass on their wisdom to unconventional cis leads. In &lt;em&gt;Dumplin’&lt;/em&gt;, a drag queen coaches Willowdean via Dolly Parton: “Find out who you are and do it on purpose.” In &lt;em&gt;Queen America&lt;/em&gt;, Samantha discovers her talent at a drag karaoke night. At a charity bikini car wash staffed with volunteers from a LGBTQ centre, &lt;em&gt;Insatiable&lt;/em&gt;’s Patty bonds with a trans woman over their shared body insecurities (“If anyone understands feeling uncomfortable in their own skin, it’s me”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;Little Miss Sunshine&lt;/em&gt; opens with seven-year-old Olive Hoover’s blinking, bespectacled eyes glued to a fuzzy VHS recording of a Miss America winner’s ceremony. Taking an unselfconscious stance, with her tiny hand resting on her pot belly, she rewinds and replays the moment of coronation. Then, slowly, she starts to imitate Miss America – hands stuck to the sides of her face in shock, mouth wide in a hysterical, disbelieving grin, then copying a graceful wave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Soaking up the recording like a sponge, Olive (Abigail Breslin) is a soft and malleable young girl. We watch her internalise her father’s speeches on winners and losers, and blindly follow her grandfather’s pageant coaching advice. One scene in a diner sees her father tell her, “If you eat lots of ice-cream, you’re gonna become big and fat”, &lt;em&gt;unlike&lt;/em&gt; the women in Miss America – she responds by pushing her bowl away and saying, “Does anyone want my ice-cream?” But when the rest of the family encourage her to return to it, eating it themselves with exaggerated pleasure, she’s persuaded again, picking up her spoon with glee. Like most children, Olive is confused and extremely impressionable, internalising the views of others, particularly the patriarchal figures in her life, on how she should behave. When she eventually makes it to the pageant stage, her performance violates the carefully navigated codes of female expression by making the sexual undertones of child beauty pageants explicit in her chosen talent: a strip routine to “Superfreak”. Though Olive is in many ways the most sexually oblivious candidate in the competition, she subverts the conventions of the pageant by rejecting a lightly sexualised, submissive gender performance and instead doing something more overt and assertive (Olive is genuinely enjoying herself when she dances and poses, rather than hoping to titillate her audience). Despite watching and re-watching taped performances, she has missed some of the key subtleties of pageant performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;Drop Dead Gorgeous&lt;/em&gt;, too, opens with wannabee pageant contestants watching old footage of earlier contestants. &lt;em&gt;Queen America&lt;/em&gt; sees Vicki insist a winner “has to act grateful to the point of &lt;em&gt;apologetic&lt;/em&gt;”, because “nobody likes a pretty girl who expects big things to happen to her”. Even &lt;em&gt;The Simpsons&lt;/em&gt;’ foray into beauty pageant plots, “Lisa the Beauty Queen”, sees Bart coach Lisa on winner’s etiquette: Lisa gasps with shock, and Bart narrates: “Ok, wipe away a tear, hug the loser, and now for your triumphant walk down the runway.” In &lt;em&gt;Miss Congeniality&lt;/em&gt;, when Gracie (Sandra Bullock) watches her own tapes of former pageants, she ridicules the winner with an exaggerated impression of her – weeping and gasping, interspersed with derisive cry of “Oh, if I only had a brain!” But by the film’s final scene, Gracie’s performance is as sincere as it is accurate. In the film’s simultaneous resolution and punchline, she sobs, “I’m very, very honoured, and moved and truly touched… and I really do want world peace!” Her character has been subsumed and transformed by the pageant’s ideals of femininity – and we’re meant to see her as better off for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;rtecenter&quot;&gt;
	&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;media-image attr__typeof__foaf:Image img__fid__100799 img__view_mode__media_large attr__format__media_large&quot; height=&quot;601&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/1_7.jpg?itok=JOZqnfZS&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Credit: Miss Congeniality&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
		When pageant films try and defend pageants to their audiences, they share key arguments: they are important institutions of community and tradition; they are sites of female friendships; they boost the self-esteem of young women, giving them confidence; they are scholarship programmes; they require incredible effort from contestants; they reward brains and talent and inner beauty, not (just) looks. Mothers and former beauty queens emphasise history: “Your mee-maw was Miss Blue Bonnet, I was Miss Blue Bonnet, and you will be Miss Blue Bonnet”, Brooke says to her daughter in &lt;em&gt;Whip It&lt;/em&gt;. “I will not have you make a mockery of me or this institution, which has been a cornerstone of our community since 1933,” Rosie declares to her daughter in &lt;em&gt;Dumplin’&lt;/em&gt;. But this obsession with tradition is almost always rejected by young leads, who either hope for pageants to change, or refuse to be a part of them completely. If they do come round to pageants, it’s for very different reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The lead characters of &lt;em&gt;Dumplin’&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Insatiable&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Queen America&lt;/em&gt; et al are shocked to discover the level of effort that goes into pageants – from the intensity of the beauty makeovers to the rigorous workouts to honing talents to finessing interview answers. &lt;em&gt;Dumplin’&lt;/em&gt; begins with Rosie exclaiming “They work so hard!”, and Willowdean sarcastically replying, “Yes, walking is so, &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; hard”: but by the end she appreciates the effort her friends have gone to in competing, and is surprised to see genuine talent rewarded. For some, the simple fact that pageants are hard work is enough to redeem them morally – it’s a distinctly American idea that something hard won is therefore intrinsically worth winning. Some refute this idea: &lt;em&gt;Drop Dead Gorgeous&lt;/em&gt; makes a mockery of sheer dedication with the anorexic Miss Minnesota Teen Princess, Mary, who brags of the hours of practice, exercise and preparation she put into the pageant from her hospital bed. The first line of dialogue in &lt;em&gt;Little Miss Sunshine &lt;/em&gt;is Olive’s dad declaring, “There’s two kinds of people in this world: winners and losers”. Want it badly enough, he insists, and work hard enough, and you’ll be a winner. The film sees all the characters grapple with the realisation that they might not be winners, and eventually come to understanding that desperately striving towards an abstract idea of winning might be meaningless, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But what if pageants aren’t about hard work, or success, but friendship? Can sisterhood transform pageants into an inherently empowering space? Though &lt;em&gt;Miss Congeniality&lt;/em&gt; claims over and over again “It is &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;a beauty pageant! It is a scholarship program!”, Gracie is not won over by the pageant’s academic credentials, but by the other contestants. When she is asked on stage, “As you may know, there are many who consider the Miss United States pageant to be outdated and anti-feminist. What would you say to them?” she responds, “I would have to say, I used to be one of them. And then I came here and I realized that these women are smart, terrific people who are just trying to make a difference in the world. We’ve become really good friends […] For me, this experience has been one of the most rewarding and liberating experiences of my life.” Her concerns about problematic ideals of womanhood promoted by the organisation seemingly evaporate. In &lt;em&gt;Miss Congeniality&lt;/em&gt;, the real Miss America is the friends we made along the way. &lt;em&gt;Dumplin’&lt;/em&gt;, too, ends with the revelation that and beauty contests could foster friendships – “Who knew beauty pageants could be a team sport?” – though it is more nuanced here, as friendship is what enables the pageant to be changed, from the inside, into a more inclusive, body-positive space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Of course, the simple fact that an organisation contains kind or intelligent women who get along with and support each other is not enough to make it a feminist project. In &lt;em&gt;Whip It&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Little Miss Sunshine&lt;/em&gt;, our leads find better communities elsewhere – the vapid, poisonous culture of pageants just drives them closer to their families, or a free-wheeling, ass-kicking roller derby troupe. And in &lt;em&gt;Drop Dead Gorgeous&lt;/em&gt;, Amber (Kirsten Dunst) finds friends willing to quit the pageant so she can succeed, but it’s not enough to prevent the pageant from seeming like a terrible, corrupt institution full of vindictive, power-hungry hypocrites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;Miss Congeniality&lt;/em&gt; ultimately redeems pageants, as does &lt;em&gt;Dumplin’&lt;/em&gt;, on the condition that they undergo some fairly radical changes to become more inclusive to different kinds of womanhood. In &lt;em&gt;Whip It&lt;/em&gt;, pageants are ultimately harmless, and can even be great for the people in them – as long as they want to be there. &lt;em&gt;Insatiable&lt;/em&gt;’s principles are so scatter-shot it’s impossible to get any sense of whether pageants are a positive or negative force in a morally chaotic world, both it and &lt;em&gt;Queen America&lt;/em&gt; often feel like they are trying hard to be edgy and caustic wherever possible, and their satire ends up missing the mark as a result. Older but still more cutting, &lt;em&gt;Drop Dead Gorgeous&lt;/em&gt; comes at pageants with an edge both sharp and serrated, but for me, the film is so cruel to all its characters – including the disabled, ill and vulnerable – that it dilutes its condemnation of the beauty pageant world. But &lt;em&gt;Little Miss Sunshine&lt;/em&gt;, to me, manages to be both empathetic, warm and fiercely against the ideals pageantry upholds. Olive subverts the pageant so completely that she is banned from entering one in the state of California ever again. “You know what?” Olive’s brother Dwayne declares, “Fuck beauty contests. Life is one fucking beauty contest after another.”&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--

	&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-9b7b09ff-7fff-9c6a-cc97-db26221e0092&quot;&gt;The greatest shock about the loss of Paddy Ashdown is that he was still, aged 77, such a force of energy. I honestly believed that if we had a power crisis at any point we could plug him into the National Grid and he would light up Britain.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-9b7b09ff-7fff-9c6a-cc97-db26221e0092&quot;&gt;He led a political party, served his country as a Royal Marine and intelligence officer, ran Bosnia, wrote eight books and two volumes of diaries, and was still determined to surpass his grandchildren when skiing.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-9b7b09ff-7fff-9c6a-cc97-db26221e0092&quot;&gt;When the rest of us were beaten back by the EU referendum result or bad elections – and there were plenty of those - Paddy had an extraordinary ability to regroup and single-handedly move forward against the most formidable odds. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-9b7b09ff-7fff-9c6a-cc97-db26221e0092&quot;&gt;He never stopped trying to improve the lives of others, make democracy reach beyond Westminster and, above all, understand that our friends and neighbours stretch around the planet.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-9b7b09ff-7fff-9c6a-cc97-db26221e0092&quot;&gt;He was trained in guerilla tactics from an early age – and he used them with great skill throughout his life. His mother and father moved to Australia leaving him in the UK in his teens. When he ditched “diplomacy” (think 007) and pursued a political career, he and Jane (who he married in 1962) were down to their last pennies until he obtained a job as a youth worker.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-9b7b09ff-7fff-9c6a-cc97-db26221e0092&quot;&gt;As Liberal Democrat leader (from 1988-1999) he “banged on about Bosnia” every week in parliament, to the groans of most MPs, but he was vindicated: a humanitarian atrocity was happening on Europe’s doorstep. He fought for the Hong Kong Chinese to obtain British citizenship, a deeply unpopular position but the right one. He inherited a political party on the verge of bankruptcy – financial and political - and by dint of personality built it back up again.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-9b7b09ff-7fff-9c6a-cc97-db26221e0092&quot;&gt;In 2015 – when most people in their seventies are planning retirement – he took on mission impossible and ran the post-coalition general election campaign. It was a grim, thankless task, which he delivered with his usual humour, energy and inspiration. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-9b7b09ff-7fff-9c6a-cc97-db26221e0092&quot;&gt;Often he believed he was fighting all these battles on his own – “pushing a huge boulder up a mountain single-handed”.  He wasn’t; he leaves behind so many of us who would have willingly followed him anywhere. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-9b7b09ff-7fff-9c6a-cc97-db26221e0092&quot;&gt;He loved having people around him who would give him an argument – he rarely employed people who agreed with him.  He grew and fostered countless careers. He always found time to give encouragement, mentoring and support to so many, from deputy prime minister Nick Clegg to the newest press officer in the party. The only payment he expected in return was fun company, a good argument and great gossip.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-9b7b09ff-7fff-9c6a-cc97-db26221e0092&quot;&gt;Words were so important to him: crafting questions to the prime minister, lighting up a hall with a passionate speech, delivering a broadcast soundbite that captured the essence of the moment. Later in life, his articles and his books were a matter of intense pride and he approached his role as a writer with &lt;/span&gt;meticulousness &lt;span&gt;and care.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-9b7b09ff-7fff-9c6a-cc97-db26221e0092&quot;&gt;He leaves behind a legacy of showing the right way to be a politician in the turbulent times we live in – with tolerance, liberalism and social justice at the heart of his values.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-9b7b09ff-7fff-9c6a-cc97-db26221e0092&quot;&gt;Family was everything to him and his pride in his children, grandchildren and love for Jane were a defining part of who he was.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-9b7b09ff-7fff-9c6a-cc97-db26221e0092&quot;&gt;He was astounded by the outpouring when his illness became public. He felt other people went through much more in their lives. During the last conversation that we had about his health, he said that he didn’t want any fuss. So for one last time, I am going to argue with my former boss, mentor, friend and say: he was wrong, let the fuss commence - he led a life that deserved it. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jim Mattis was the last general of the American Era</title>

	America is abandoning its outposts and retreating within the walls of its borders. We may never be able to restore our global leadership.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-node-image field-type-image field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;noscript class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoints=&quot;300 768 1024&quot; data-adaptive-image-300-img=&quot;&amp;lt;img class=&amp;quot;adaptive-image&amp;quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&amp;quot;300&amp;quot; typeof=&amp;quot;foaf:Image&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2018/12/gettyimages-997844918.jpg?itok=hLpr8Jdv&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&quot; data-adaptive-image-768-img=&quot;&amp;lt;img class=&amp;quot;adaptive-image&amp;quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&amp;quot;768&amp;quot; typeof=&amp;quot;foaf:Image&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2018/12/gettyimages-997844918.jpg?itok=hLpr8Jdv&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&quot; data-adaptive-image-1024-img=&quot;&amp;lt;img class=&amp;quot;adaptive-image&amp;quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&amp;quot;1024&amp;quot; typeof=&amp;quot;foaf:Image&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2018/12/gettyimages-997844918.jpg?itok=hLpr8Jdv&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&quot; data-adaptive-image-max-img=&quot;&amp;lt;img class=&amp;quot;adaptive-image&amp;quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&amp;quot;max&amp;quot; typeof=&amp;quot;foaf:Image&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2018/12/gettyimages-997844918.jpg?itok=hLpr8Jdv&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&quot;&gt;&lt;img typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2018/12/gettyimages-997844918.jpg?itok=hLpr8Jdv&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;
	The world is no longer safe for democracy. For the past century, the United States stood watch as Western alliances expanded and freedom spread. Progress ebbed and flowed. Ground was undoubtedly lost under President Donald Trump. Yet we could take solace in knowing America’s military remained in the steady, safe hands of a highly respected retired Marine general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	That all changed yesterday. American Defense Secretary John Mattis’ &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/world/north-america/2018/12/jim-mattis-was-last-grown-trump-s-cabinet-here-s-why-his-resignation&quot;&gt;sudden resignation&lt;/a&gt; shook the foundations of our national security structure in a way few personnel or policy changes could reverberate. Our nation, the world, is now grappling with the loss of the one man we believed could save us from catastrophe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	He was a good soldier. Not one prone to quickly throwing in the towel over personal slights or shifting political winds. So what does it say about President Trump’s plans that a man so committed to his duty would feel it simply untenable to carry on? It is alarming to think that a man who weathered fierce battles and myriad political storms in Washington could simply no longer muster the will or way to fight for his country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Unlike many in the current administration, General Mattis wasn’t afraid to speak truth to power. His was the voice of reason in an age of virulance. He would remind the president of the costs and consequences of words and wars. I shudder at the thought of how precariously we are now perched on the precipice of calamitous conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Despite the tweets and tempestuous times at the White House, we were told the generals were a safeguard for our national security. One by one, Trump has dishonorably dismissed them, or made them so disillusioned with their duty that they had no choice but to leave. Those that remain in the administration, Bolton, Pompeo, and Miller, are largely illogical idealogues. They place the attainment of political gain over the advice of those military officers. Gone is the notion that our nation is bound by principles, pacts, and proven past practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	What does this mean for the world? In short, the United States will no longer serve in the tallest and most tested watchtowers on the frontiers of the free world. We are abandoning our outposts and retreating within the walls of our borders. The withdrawals from Syria and Afghanistan are clearly illustrative of this new policy. They are the reasons General Mattis could no longer face the men and women of our armed forces with a clear conscience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	No respectable military leader would embrace Trump’s shortsighted, self-interested, and strategically stupid moves. They know all too well how hard-fought were the gains we achieved in Iraq, Syria, and Afghanistan. They can name those we lost. They don’t want to go back there again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	After Trump pulled the US out of the Iran Deal, I &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/world/north-america/2018/05/pulling-out-iran-deal-donald-trump-has-ushered-end-american-era&quot;&gt;wrote here in the &lt;em&gt;New Statesman&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that we are entering the post-American era – a time of dramatically diminished American influence around the world. My warning to foreign leaders was that the United States could no longer be counted on to serve as a pillar of global security and stability. New alliances need to be formed, new strategies devised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Yesterday, we witnessed the last general of the American era bring a sobering end to his service. It was an acknowledgement that even his brilliance and bravery were no match for the populist forces sweeping over a significant part of our nation. Historians will look back at this as a watershed moment. This is when the long and steadfast tradition of our military defending freedom and democracy died.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There will still be great American military leaders. Yet, none will enjoy the status and sway of their storied predecessors. Their mission, will now be more narrowly defined in the national interest. The lore and legacy of indispensable country coming to the aid of democracy in its hour of need will fade. We have surrendered the special sense of purpose and pride that inspired generations to its ranks and allies to its side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	General Mattis will be remembered for answering the call of duty one last time. He diligently defended an institution, a nation he loved so dearly. We may never be able to restore our lost lustre and or the unrivaled global leadership we once enjoyed. I sincerely hope that military and civilian leaders of the future will look back on his service as a source of strength. The last general of the American era is likely to continue to be a stark symbol of how far we have fallen and what it will take to restore our honor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;
	Nicola Sturgeon’s dry sense of humour is one of her more attractive traits. So it was that when she visited Theresa May in Downing Street this week she took along a Christmas present – a bottle of Misty Isle gin. That the gin was from the Isle of Skye, the constituency of the SNP’s Westminster leader Iain Blackford, who had been dismissively told by Nicholas Soames to go back there in the Commons the day before, was entirely intentional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There was less humour in the statement made by the First Minister outside No. 10, following the meeting. “The immigration white paper and the proposals in it represent an act of vandalism on the Scottish economy and public services,” she told waiting hacks. “Our demographics mean that we need to attract people to live and work in Scotland, and yet the proposals in this paper estimate that EU immigration will reduce by 85 per cent. That will send Scotland’s population into decline. It will depress economic growth and reduce revenues, so the impact would be devastating. It would also deprive us of talented, hard-working individuals who enrich our society.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There are two things to say about this. First, it is vanishingly rare these days to hear a political leader set out such a positive, liberal view of immigrants and immigration. Second, there aren’t all that many people in Scotland of any political persuasion who would disagree with the First Minister’s sentiments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There is a stark difference in the immigration narrative north and south of the border. Where the prevailing discussion at Westminster is how to better control and reduce immigration, the question at Holyrood is how to attract more of it. Here is Jackson Carlaw, currently leading the Scottish Conservatives in Ruth Davidson’s absence, speaking during a debate in Edinburgh earlier this year. I’ll quote him at a little length.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	“Let me tackle directly some of the myths that are often repeated to me as an MSP—myths founded on concerns that migration alone is responsible for the pressures on our infrastructure and public services, which is simply not true. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	“Yes, we have a housing shortage, but that is not because of migration. We have seen radical shifts in the way that we choose to live, with far more single home occupancy and longer life expectancy. Homes that might have been expected to appear on the open market two decades ago are now still happily occupied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	“Yes, we have busy hospitals and general practitioner surgeries, but that is not because of migration. We have a population that is living longer but is not always well. Even in the lifetime of this parliament, we have seen new issues that were not envisaged when we first met, such as dementia and diabetes arising from obesity, present enormous strategic and budgetary challenges to the national health service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	“Yes, we have busy schools, colleges and universities, but that is not because of migration. Far more of our young people stay longer at school and proceed into further education of whatever kind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	“The suggestion that migration is at the heart of the stresses in our public life and services is a fantasy, and a malicious and self-deceiving one at that. Let me be absolutely clear—I say this personally and on behalf of the Scottish Conservatives—that migration and immigration from wherever are good, necessary and desirable. There is a strong, powerful and unarguable case for migration to Scotland and we are on its side.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Now try to imagine those words coming from the mouth of May, or Sajid Javid, or Jeremy Corbyn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The facts make their own case. Scotland’s fertility rate is lower than every other country and region in the UK. Over the next 25 years, the number of births minus the number of deaths is projected to be negative, and so any increases in population will come from migration. The 65-74 age group is projected to increase by 17 per cent over the next 25 years, while the number of people aged 75 and above is projected to increase by 79 per cent. All other age categories will decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An ageing population, increasing demand on public services such as social care, the NHS and pensions, and a smaller group of working age people to pay for it all – you can see why demographics and immigration are at the forefront of the Scottish government’s mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This week’s white paper, as Sturgeon pointed out, has done nothing to dispel those concerns. The continued “hostile environment” embraced by the pathologically anti-immigrant May threatens to be a catastrophe for the north.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The abolition of the cap on high-skilled workers might be welcome, but the proposed £30,000 salary threshold suggests a staggering ignorance about earning potential outside London. And Scotland anyway needs access to low-skilled immigrants more than many other parts of the UK, due to its large rural economy, particularly in the tourism and agricultural sectors, and in island communities. Non-EU migration is focused in Scotland’s cities, while the countryside benefits more from EU migrants – the threat from Brexit is therefore acute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It’s in this light that Sturgeon and her ministers are seeking a Scotland-specific solution from Whitehall. There are a number of options being knocked around, but it seems unlikely May will agree to any of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One is to give more time in the country to foreign students. In the 2000s, the then Labour first minister Jack McConnell introduced the Fresh Talent initiative, which allowed overseas students to stay on in Scotland for up to two years after graduation. May as Home Secretary refused to allow a reopening of that scheme - the longest a graduate can stay in the UK today is one year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There is a suggestion that low-skilled young people from the Commonwealth and the EU could be allowed an extra year’s residency in Scotland, beyond their time in the UK, giving them longer to find a pathway to settlement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Scottish government currently has no formal role in the setting of immigrant quotas by the Home Office. The Migration Advisory Committee makes its recommendations to the Home Secretary each year on the list of shortage occupations, including for Scotland, but Scottish ministers can only make a submission to the process during the public evidence-gathering period, along with everyone else. This seems inarguably sub-optimal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	And there is a case – advanced by the think tank I run, Reform Scotland – that Scotland could be removed from all and any caps on immigration. Now that Holyrood has control over income tax, taxpayers north of the border have a different tax code, which would make it easier to monitor and restrict the location and movements of immigrants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The SNP government will early next year produce a Welcome to Scotland package, aimed at showing the nation is open to immigrants regardless of the tone at Westminster. Allowing Scotland some flexibility on immigration post-Brexit will be a test of the Union’s willingness to accommodate difference. It’s a serious matter – and it’s not at all clear that May understands that.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--

    <title>Christmas is only going to get more expensive after Brexit - unless we stay</title>

	Without a second referendum, the only question is whether to cut back this year or go for one last blowout.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-node-image field-type-image field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;noscript class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoints=&quot;300 768 1024&quot; data-adaptive-image-300-img=&quot;&amp;lt;img class=&amp;quot;adaptive-image&amp;quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&amp;quot;300&amp;quot; typeof=&amp;quot;foaf:Image&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2018/12/gettyimages-1071199942.jpg?itok=DemLMSrX&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&quot; data-adaptive-image-768-img=&quot;&amp;lt;img class=&amp;quot;adaptive-image&amp;quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&amp;quot;768&amp;quot; typeof=&amp;quot;foaf:Image&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2018/12/gettyimages-1071199942.jpg?itok=DemLMSrX&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&quot; data-adaptive-image-1024-img=&quot;&amp;lt;img class=&amp;quot;adaptive-image&amp;quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&amp;quot;1024&amp;quot; typeof=&amp;quot;foaf:Image&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2018/12/gettyimages-1071199942.jpg?itok=DemLMSrX&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&quot; data-adaptive-image-max-img=&quot;&amp;lt;img class=&amp;quot;adaptive-image&amp;quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&amp;quot;max&amp;quot; typeof=&amp;quot;foaf:Image&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2018/12/gettyimages-1071199942.jpg?itok=DemLMSrX&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&quot;&gt;&lt;img typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2018/12/gettyimages-1071199942.jpg?itok=DemLMSrX&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;
	Which is it for you this Christmas? Cautious scaling back or one last blow-out before Brexit hits?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Christmas can be difficult for families at the best of times. Those big boozy Christmas dinners and present-laden trees don’t come cheap. Back in 2015 the average family was already spending more than £800 on Christmas. And with a Brexit-driven rise in the cost of living already hitting, things are only set to get worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	According to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/timeseries/kj5u/mm23&quot;&gt;Office of National Statistics&lt;/a&gt;, the cost of heating oil is 47 per cent higher than it was in 2015 -- and energy firms have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/sep/04/brexit-could-drive-up-energy-bills-say-power-firms&quot;&gt;warned&lt;/a&gt; that prices may go up even more after Brexit. Meanwhile, since 2015 the price of a standard Christmas dinner (minus alcohol -- let’s not even go there) has leapt by over 30 per cent as tracked by the Good Housekeeping Annual Christmas Dinner survey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This rise is partly a result of the devalued pound relative to the euro (it just costs more to import goods -- which bizarrely include potatoes and sprouts). But it’s also because of a rise in transportation costs: before we voted to leave, lorries coming over from Europe with our Christmas oranges, sprouts and potatoes would return back to the continent with goods they were importing from us. But because of Brexit uncertainty, the EU is just importing less from us, as continental firms seek to mitigate potential supply chain disruptions in the event of a no-deal Brexit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	So where does this leave cash-strapped mums, who are the ones who tend to manage household budgets, and who are almost invariably the ones in charge of Christmas? Over on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mumsnet.com/Talk/eu_referendum_2016_/3438562-Brexit-affecting-this-Christmas-versus-others?pg=1&quot;&gt;Mumsnet&lt;/a&gt;, mums are divided over how to approach Christmas this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Some said that they were cutting back in the anticipation of a uncertain year ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	“I&#039;m trying to cut back as I&#039;m very mindful that this could be the last comfortable Christmas for a good while,” wrote one user. “Yes,” agreed another, “it just feels wrong to be frittering money away when you don&#039;t know what is coming.” Another mum said she was “limiting spending” as she was trying to “clear debt before Brexit day.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It was the same story for their Leave-voting parents who were also feeling the pinch. “My parents, who both voted Leave, have noticeably cut back as &#039;everything is so expensive now&#039;,” explained one mum, while another said that her parents-in-law were talking about scaling back on presents this year. “Apparently the value of their pensions and investments have gone down and they are worried that things will get worse. They voted leave but I can see that reality is finally starting to hit them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Others were trying to get their essential spending in place now while they could still afford it. Several mentioned replacing white goods or finally getting round to home improvements they’d been putting off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	“We had building work done this year and also replaced electrical goods. I&#039;m buying additional food which will keep and alcohol, not really for Christmas, more for expected price rises and/or lack of availability depending on what ends up happening,” one mum explained. “Absolutely,” said another. “I&#039;m spending on what I can to mitigate the effects” of Brexit. One mum who said she was cutting back her spending nevertheless said she was “spending funds on dried goods etc which will keep.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But many mums remained defiant: if this was going to be the last good Christmas they had in a while, they were going to make it count.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	“I feel as though this Christmas is a last hurrah,” wrote one mum, while another said that ”If it’s the last one we may be able to enjoy I’m damn well making sure my family enjoy it. £500 blown on prezzies and a lavish dinner will not save us if we lose our jobs or can’t afford the mortgage anymore.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The general sentiment of the thread seems to be summed up by the mum who wrote, “Let&#039;s enjoy the last Christmas before chaos. Next year will be hellish.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But it doesn’t have to be. There is still a way out of the Brexit doldrums. Theresa May may have survived her no confidence vote, but there is still no way her deal is getting through parliament. That means the choice facing us is between no deal -- or no Brexit at all. And only the people, with a People’s Vote, have the right to decide on that.  &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--

    <title>Emmanuel Macron’s most offensive, self-centred and strangest comments in 2018</title>

	Emmanuel Macron has had quite the year. Having played 2017 on easy mode (after his surprise presidential win, his first economic and social reforms were met with little opposition owing to his huge parliamentary majority), the French president was widely unprepared for what came next. The little prince fell to earth mere days after his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sudouest.fr/2018/07/16/victoire-des-bleus-la-folle-soiree-d-emmanuel-macron-en-images-5236753-6016.php&quot;&gt;show-off celebrations&lt;/a&gt; of France’s World Cup victory: his bodyguard Benella beat up demonstrators at a May Day rally while posing as a police office, causing the first scandal of Macron’s presidency. Then, as his rating were in free-fall, his ministers launched a festival of resignations. And street protests, which had been contained in the spring, suddenly made a comeback in the &lt;em&gt;gilets jaunes&lt;/em&gt; movement, which caught fire across France.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As Macron turns 41 today and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/world/europe/2017/12/emmanuel-macron-s-most-offensive-self-centered-and-disconcerting-comments-2017&quot;&gt;for the second time running&lt;/a&gt;, here are this year’s most frustrating, weird and downright outrageous soundbites that just might have angered the French enough for them to cover the Arc de Triomphe with tags calling for his resignation. Happy birthday, Manu*!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;On the French&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lavoixdunord.fr/439685/article/2018-08-30/gaulois-refractaires-macron-invoque-un-trait-d-humour?_ga=2.182872102.1668135101.1545314181-1219755417.1544516892&quot;&gt;The French are “Gauls resistant to change”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Macron has developed a habit of insulting his compatriots from abroad. Last year, on a presidential visit to Greece, he called the French “slackers” - in Denmark this year, he compared his decidedly backwards fellow Gauls to the Danes, who are apparently “orderly Lutherians”. What’s next?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	“&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.letelegramme.fr/france/macron-la-france-se-tiendrait-autrement-si-les-francais-se-plaignaient-moins-04-10-2018-12097377.php&quot;&gt;France would be better off if the French complained less”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	France would also be better off if the president complained less about the French complaining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tf1.fr/tmc/quotidien-avec-yann-barthes/videos/l-image-jour-de-paul-larrouturou-1.html&quot;&gt;Police officers “can’t write”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This one was a “joke” he made to a bodyguard who had lent his briefcase so that the president could sign an autograph on it. He laughed it off, but replied: “Bastard.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nouvelobs.com/politique/20180627.OBS8814/les-bretons-c-est-la-mafia-francaise-quand-la-plaisanterie-de-macron-ne-fait-pas-rire.html&quot;&gt;“The Bretons are the French mafia”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Macron said this to the Pope, which must be some kind of record because 1) It makes no sense, 2) Why?? and 3) It managed to hurt both the Bretons and the Italians, for obvious mafia-related reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;On young people&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	* &lt;a href=&quot;http://lavdn.lavoixdunord.fr/399935/article/2018-06-19/tu-m-appelles-monsieur-le-president-de-la-republique&quot;&gt;“You call me mister president” &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	You all know the story: a kid called Macron “Manu”, and Manu lost it. Not a great look, nor a good strategy to avoid being called Manu (ever heard of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2013/04/15/what-is-the-streisand-effect&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Streisand effect&lt;/a&gt;?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.francetvinfo.fr/politique/emmanuel-macron/video-ta-mere-elle-merite-mieux-que-ca-en-visite-a-saint-martin-emmanuel-macron-fait-la-morale-a-une-jeune-braqueur_2963867.html&quot;&gt;“You mother deserves better”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In the French Antilles, Macron lectured a young man who said he had just been released from prison. This statement isn’t very shocking - but it’s noticeable, because Macron loves to make young people, who he addresses with the informal “tu” pronoun, promise to do better. There has however been no sign of policies that address young people’s concerns. Young people deserve better too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;On the &lt;em&gt;gilets jaunes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Macron has been famously silent on the topic, which largely contributed to the &lt;em&gt;gilets jaunes&lt;/em&gt; thinking he did not take them seriously and offered too little, too late. He pretended to make concessions (more on this later), but then said that he wouldn’t reintroduce the tax on the very rich:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rfi.fr/france/20181210-gilets-jaunes-emmanuel-macron-smic-primes-isf-violences&quot;&gt;“Going back [on the tax] would weaken us. I need our big business, our most wealthy citizens, to help the nation to succeed.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Macron is what happens when sociological concepts - here &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_power&quot;&gt;Bourdieu’s symbolic violence&lt;/a&gt; - come to life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;On money&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKkUkUFbqmE&quot;&gt;“We put a crazy amount of dough in social care, and people are still poor!”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Yes, French president Emmanuel Macron said this. He even posted the video on his own Twitter account. French president Emmanuel Macron somehow thought this was a good idea. I’m starting to believe that French president Emmanuel Macron is an elaborate meme come to life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/EmmanuelMacron/status/986552182332944389&quot;&gt;“In France, we always look at the penny we lose, never the one we win!”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Your guess is as good as mine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.liberation.fr/direct/element/y-a-pas-dargent-magique-repond-emmanuel-macron-a-une-soignante-qui-deplore-le-manque-de-moyens-des-h_80049&quot;&gt;“There is no magic money tree”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Channelling Theresa May! Always a great plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;On migrants&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bfmtv.com/politique/migrants-pour-macron-il-faut-se-garder-des-faux-bons-sentiments-1347382.html&quot;&gt;“We must be wary of false showings of good conscience”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Criticised by a Nobel Prize winner for his “lack of humanity” on migrants, Macron replied that, really, it’s intellectuals worrying about said migrants we should be suspicious about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.huffingtonpost.fr/2018/05/28/macron-annonce-que-mamoudou-gassama-va-etre-naturalise-francais-et-integrer-les-pompiers_a_23444968/&quot;&gt;Awarding French citizenship to Mamoudou Gassama, the Malian migrant who rescued an infant was an “exception”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This guy went viral, so I guess he’s allowed to stay here, but that doesn’t mean I’m actually going to fix any of France’s structural problems regarding our racist immigration policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.huffingtonpost.fr/2018/12/10/cette-petite-phrase-de-macron-sur-limmigration-inquiete-sos-racisme_a_23614657/&quot;&gt;“I want the nation to agree with itself on its identity, that we have a debate on immigration”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This was part of Macron’s TV address to the &lt;em&gt;gilets jaunes&lt;/em&gt;, which was otherwise focused on economic measures. It’s been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.20minutes.fr/societe/2392527-20181211-gilets-jaunes-propos-macron-immigration-augurent-rien-bon-selon-sos-racisme&quot;&gt;flagged&lt;/a&gt; by non-profit SOS Racisme for “scapegoating immigrants”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;On himself&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	His critics? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lopinion.fr/video/polemique/affaire-benalla-qu-ils-viennent-me-chercher-lance-macron-l-opposition-157692&quot;&gt;“They can come and get me”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Incredibly enough, this was Macron’s reply following the Benalla scandal: “If they’re looking for the person at fault, it’s me. They can come and get me.” (They can’t. It’s called “presidential immunity”.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nouvelobs.com/politique/20180328.OBS4283/quand-macron-se-voyait-en-jeune-male-blanc.html&quot;&gt;“I am not ready to apologise for being a young white male. Sixty years ago, a young white male was the master of the world.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Alright, Macron actually said this in 2010, but the book that revealed this gem was published this year. Please enjoy responsibly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/WKJQ9dIUBMg?t=40&quot;&gt;“Oh, how the bird worried the wolf - how he wanted to catch him! But the bird was cleverer, and the wolf simply couldn&#039;t do anything about it.” &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This is an extract from &lt;em&gt;Peter and the Wolf&lt;/em&gt;, which Macron narrated to an audience during a “Russian soirée” at the Elysée. “Louis XIV, who loved dancing, often acted in ballets hosted at the palace”, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lemonde.fr/emmanuel-macron/article/2018/05/05/emmanuel-macron-sur-la-voie-royale_5294636_5008430.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Le Monde&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; noted as comparison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;On the press&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-14/macron-kicks-french-press-out-of-the-elysee-presidential-palace&quot;&gt;In February, Macron announced that he is kicking the press out of the presidential palace.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Rude. (And &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-25/french-presidential-press-corp-says-eviction-dents-press-freedom&quot;&gt;quite dangerous for the freedom of the French press&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Benalla scandal? &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/afpfr/status/1022408849465196544&quot;&gt;“A storm in a tea cup”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When in doubt, gaslight the media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bfmtv.com/politique/emmanuel-macron-attaque-les-fadaises-des-journalistes-1494738.html&quot;&gt;“The press doesn’t seek truth anymore”, “the media wants to become a judicial power”, “journalists have erased the presumption of innocence”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Gaslighting didn’t work? Just shout “fake news”!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;On democracy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.leparisien.fr/politique/bottom-up-quand-macron-se-prend-les-pieds-dans-le-franglais-01-04-2018-7641174.php&quot;&gt;“Democracy is the most bottom-up system in the world”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This already makes little sense in English. He said it in French, but used English for “bottom-up”, which is management nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.huffingtonpost.fr/2018/08/28/thierry-coste-le-lobbyiste-des-chasseurs-qui-a-precipite-le-depart-de-nicolas-hulot_a_23510698/&quot;&gt;“I don’t know how he got in.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Quizzed by his environment minister on how a hunting lobbyist had managed to invade a meeting on hunting regulations, Macron, who clearly knew how the person got in, pretended he had no idea. Not very bottom-up. (The minister proceeded to resign.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/EmmanuelMacron/status/983408251864846336&quot;&gt;“The link between church and state is damaged. We must fix it.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	We really, really don’t. It’s called “secularity”, it’s enshrined in the Constitution and the secular laws of 1905, and is considered a fundamental principle of French democracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;On the job market&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lci.fr/politique/video-macron-je-traverse-la-rue-je-vous-en-trouve-un-emploi-a-l-elysee-le-president-fait-la-lecon-a-un-jeune-horticulteur-chomeur-2098519.html&quot;&gt;“I cross the street and I find you a job!”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Macron thus replied to a young gardener who was describing his struggle to find work in his profession. He also advised him to look for work as a waiter instead.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;On following the rules&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/emmanuelmacron/status/989244900708442112&quot;&gt;“You don&#039;t always have to follow the rules. That&#039;s bullshit!”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	That was the French president’s advice to privileged American students at George Washington University. Don’t try it at home, though - French activists, students, rail workers, &lt;em&gt;gilets jaunes&lt;/em&gt; and other protesters will tell you that all you’ll get is &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/keizolebos19/status/1069955458600001543&quot;&gt;teargas&lt;/a&gt; and, if you’re unlucky, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.huffingtonpost.fr/2018/12/19/defigure-par-un-tir-de-flashball-ce-gilet-jaune-lance-une-cagnotte-pour-payer-son-nouveau-visage_a_23622359/&quot;&gt;a life-altering injury&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;On the Republic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/BFMTV/status/1019882656899784704&quot;&gt;“The Republic is untouchable”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	That was during the Benalla scandal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;On French history&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Brevesdepresse/status/992421154005704705&quot;&gt;“Those for whom the most important battle is on housing aid worth €50” don&#039;t really know France and its history&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Years in French history during which revolts were sparked by taxes/economic inequality: 1624, 1630, 1634-37, 1640, 1643, 1645, 1659, 1656-62, 1653-65, 1666, 1674, 1675, 1707, 1749, 1789...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.liberation.fr/france/2018/11/08/macron-petain-et-la-petite-phrase-la-com-de-l-elysee-deraille_1690920&quot;&gt;Marshall Pétain [who surrendered France to the Nazis] was “a great soldier” even if he made “macabre choices”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Please, Manu… I beg you… Just...don’t...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;BONUS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	In this video, Macron can be seen visibly tipsy, in the middle of the Benalla scandal, on the same day he’s dared his critics to “come and get him”. “I’m with the people, we’re happy, everything is alright!” he says, looking very relaxed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Let’s hope this will come true in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Simon Amstell: The refugee crisis shows up how ridiculous we are</title>

	“It wasn’t even a full day – 11-5 – not even a full working day,” says Simon Amstell. “After that I thought ‘God, imagine having a job.’” The comedian, TV host and film director is explaining how he came to be spending an afternoon putting in a shift at a busy shop in London’s Carnaby Street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The shop in question is no ordinary one, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://choose.love/&quot;&gt;Choose Love&lt;/a&gt;, an outlet where &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2017/12/choose-love-shop-where-you-can-spend-hundreds-and-walk-away-nothing&quot;&gt;shoppers can “buy” items that are then donated to refugees&lt;/a&gt;. It was set up by Help Refugees, a charity that emerged in response to the 2015 refugee crisis. Many British comedians have championed the cause since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Yet Amstell, who says he struggled to connect with TV footage of the refugee crisis, stumbled upon the issue almost by chance. He came across the Choose Love shop in 2017 while hunting for Christmas presents. “I was going to go in and buy what I thought was a bobble hat,” he recalls. Once inside, he learned who the bobble hat was really intended for, and ended up buying his boyfriend a mental health support package. “I thought, he might think ‘where is my gift?’ But he felt good about it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Some months later, he attended &lt;em&gt;The Jungle&lt;/em&gt;, a play about the Calais refugee camp written by former volunteers in the camp and starring refugees. “It really affected me, in a way that I am not usually affected by plays,” he recalls. “It was like a kind of empathy machine.” Once again, though, chance played a part. “I remembered my friend Toby [Regbo] lives with someone who started Help Refugees.” Amstell requested a meeting. “I just said ‘I’ll do anything you want me to do,’” he recalls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	And so it was he found himself standing outside brandishing a banner on a December afternoon. “It was quite helpful being recognised on Carnaby Street because while they were talking about some jokes they liked, I could drag them towards this shop.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Amstell, who first became known for his off-beat interviews on the Noughties show &lt;em&gt;Popworld&lt;/em&gt;, insists his main interest is human relationships (his latest film, &lt;em&gt;Benjamin, &lt;/em&gt;is about the personal life of a film-maker). Nevertheless, in 2017, he wrote and directed the mockumentary &lt;em&gt;Carnage, &lt;/em&gt;in which commentators of the future look back on the outlandish, animal-eating customs of the early 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century. Amstell is a vegan, but now he is also a Help Refugees volunteer. So is there a &lt;em&gt;Carnage &lt;/em&gt;for the refugee crisis?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	“Whatever the creative spark that is in you, it doesn’t respond to that request,” he says. “&lt;em&gt;Carnage &lt;/em&gt;came from one line of stand up.” Nevertheless, he sees nothing incompatible with the subject matter and comedy. “In terms of my stand up, most of it has been very personal and sometimes about depression and anxiety and difficult relationships. All that stuff didn’t start funny. When I got dumped by someone – that isn’t initially hilarious.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	He finds the humour in the ludicrousness of the situation. And there are parallels. “&lt;em&gt;Carnage&lt;/em&gt; looked at the future of humanity and how ridiculous we have been. With the refugee crisis, I suppose you could talk about how ridiculous it is that we perceive people with the same eyes, limbs and hair as so separate and often less than us.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This denial in the face of the accident of birth is, he points out, underlined by the fact the monarchy still exists. “As absurd as that is, there must still be an idea that the Queen deserves to be in that place, while other people deserve to be homeless, on the street,” he says. “There’s probably something funny to be made out of that.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Labour’s continued indulgence of Chris Williamson says more about the party than you think</title>

	The Derby North MP’s continued career not only has political implications but policy ones, too. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;
	What is left to say about Labour and anti-Semitism? The row is back in the headlines again after Chris Williamson, the Derby North MP and Corbynite ultra-loyalist, is under fire for signing and sharing a petition calling for the Islington Assembly to rescind its ban on Gilad Atzmon, a jazz saxophonist who has blamed the Grenfell Tower disaster on “Jerusalemites”, and who has been condemned as an anti-Semite by organisations as politically varied as Jews Against Zionism and Hope Not Hate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Williamson has claimed that it was only after sharing the petition that he learnt that Atzmon is “not confined to the jazz world”, a claim that for many stretches credulity as the opening paragraph of the petition is “Islington Council in London has decided to prevent Gilad Atzmon from performing with the Blockheads on 21 December. This outrageous decision by the Council was in response to pressure from a single ardent pro-Israel campaigner who said he would not attend the concert if Gilad is on stage”. One wonders why Williamson believed that there had been a complaint &lt;em&gt;at all&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But the Labour leadership has accepted his account of events and the call from the Jewish Labour Movement and the Board of Deputies of British Jews for Williamson to lose the whip will go unheeded. The continued indulgence of Williamson is a running sore as far as relations between Labour and the bulk of British Jews are concerned, a visible sign of a leadership that does not take their concerns seriously. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But the Williamson saga in particular is emblematic of another and undercovered weakness in the Corbyn project. The one thing that no-one can seriously dispute is that Williamson’s continued membership of the Labour party is a drag on the party ticket. The damage is partly electoral, in that if Labour had done as well among British Jews as it did even in its 2010 defeat in 2017, it would probably have gained enough additional seats to form a minority government, albeit in a position where Labour was still well short of being the largest party. But it is also an opportunity cost, in that every time the problem hits the headlines it distracts from the party’s messaging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Yet Jeremy Corbyn has not thrown Williamson overboard. It is hardly unprecedented for leaders to dismiss even the ultra-loyal to deal with a political problem, but it is also par for the course that Corbyn didn’t. Jeremy Corbyn’s political proximity to Williamson and his sense of loyalty to those who have stuck by him both make it highly unlikely that Williamson will ever lose the whip in any case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As a result, in the shadow cabinet, it doesn’t matter if you are setting out striking and transformational policies like Rebecca Long-Bailey, or simply pledging a better-funded version of the status quo like Richard Burgon. You are safe in your job because you have been “loyal”, regardless of if you are actually forming new policies or causing political damage as Williamson is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It’s not enough if you want to actually be a transformational government to have policies that work on paper – you have to have a ministerial team that has the ability to drive them through and the willingness to move people around when that isn’t working. Diane Abbott has thought very deeply about the institutional problems at the Home Office and has a number of policies that would, if successfully enacted, change the way that people who come into contact with that department are treated for the better. We won’t know unless Labour take office if she also has the skillset to drive those changes through a hostile department, but anyone who wants change at the Home Office had better hope so, because we can be certain that if she isn’t, she will still be in that job regardless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	David Cameron had the same affliction as Jeremy Corbyn and that is one reason why outside of education, his government achieved very few of its aims in policy terms. Transformative governments don’t just have to move people around who have failed to come up with new ideas – not everyone who is successful at forming policy in opposition is good at driving them through in government. (Take, for instance, the rolling disaster that is the Universal Credit.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	That Corbyn won’t move the loyal even when it is so transparently in his interests to do so is one reason why it feels likely that any government he leads will, like Cameron’s, look back at a record of achievement that fell far short of what it hoped for.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--

    <title>The homeless women forced to choose between abuse and violence on the streets</title>

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;
	Homeless women across the UK are increasingly entering into dangerous relationships to protect themselves from the wider risks of living on the street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While the official statistic for people sleeping rough is 4,751, figures released in December by the charity Crisis indicate that 12,300 people are sleeping on the streets while a further 12,000 are spending the night in cars, sheds, bins, buses and tents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The female homeless population is often even more hidden. The homeless charity St Mungo&#039;s those on the streets may stay away from busy areas to avoid being attacked or abused. Others are even less visible: the charity found women may be forced into swapping sex for a bed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Now new research by Brighton Women’s Centre and Homeless Link has revealed how the vulnerability of homeless women often leads them to enter into a relationship with a man for protection. In many cases, these relationships are abusive ones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Women interviewed for the report said their experiences of sexual exploitation on the streets ranged from being pimped and selling sex, to the expectation of sex to get access to accommodation and washing facilities&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One case featured a woman called Mary (all names have been changed) who had been attending the women’s group run by Brighton Women&#039;s Centre and Worthing Churches Homeless Project (WCHP) for a couple of months. Mary was sexually assaulted in the hostel where she was living. Following the assault, she started rough sleeping with her partner Roy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Mary said that as a woman sleeping rough, it was “absolutely vital” for her to be in a couple, and that she would not have survived without Roy. According to Mary, Roy was initially a supportive partner, but his behaviour became increasingly controlling. He accompanied her everywhere, frequently interrupted appointments with her women’s worker, checked her phone and diary, and threatened to harm himself and their pet should she decide to leave him. He also repeatedly accused her of sleeping with other people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The report also tells the story of Carey and Jack, who have been living together for eight years, most recently in a tent. They have a five-year-old son, who was removed by children’s services and adopted. Carey and Jack are both alcohol dependent and Carey smokes heroin. Both have been arrested at different times for assaulting the other. Carey describes Jack as her “finer half”. Some of the services involved believe that Carey is a victim of domestic abuse and needs rescuing from the relationship. But Carey believes that she would be dead if it wasn’t for Jack, and that she can’t trust services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In another case, Patricia was in a volatile relationship with Mathew, who also had high-level multiple needs. They refused to engage with services, preferring to sleep rough rather than be accommodated individually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.commonwealhousing.org.uk/static/uploads/2018/12/Couples-First-Brighton-Womens-Centre.pdf&quot;&gt;According to the report&lt;/a&gt;, homeless services often see couples as too high risk to work with, and end up denying them shelter together, which places already vulnerable women at even greater risk. Most services for homeless adults without children are for single people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It recommends that in order to provide adequate support for both individuals in the relationship, services should adopt a “couples-first” approach, which begins with unconditional acceptance of the relationship and any request to be supported and housed together. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Lisa Dando, director of Brighton Women’s Centre said this would acknowledge that a rough sleeping woman may well align herself with a man on the streets as a protective strategy even though that relationship may be abusive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	She said: “To be alone on the streets is potentially more risky in terms of potential multiple perpetrators. Understanding the nature of couples on the street is complex – abuse and protection may co-exist.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	She said any action taken by government or charities should “always be informed by appropriate needs and risk assessment of the couple and the individuals involved. Importantly whatever accommodation solution is offered, on-going wrap-around support for the couple and the individuals needs to be in place. Accommodation per se is not the solution. It will take time for the support staff to identify through working alongside the individuals the most appropriate solution which may not be the same offer as that provided at the outset.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Suzanne Jacob, the chief executive of the domestic abuse charity SafeLives, stressed the importance of training those working in homelessness frontline services in the dynamics of abuse. “Too often we place the onus on victims to leave abusive relationships, when the reality is that there may be many complex reasons why someone chooses to stay,” she said. “Homeless services and domestic abuse services must work together to ensure they are survivor-led and accessible to all.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Housing and homelessness minister Heather Wheeler responded to the figures from Crisis by citing the government’s plans to spend £1.2bn to tackle all forms of homelessness, including £100m combating rough sleeping. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But Ashley Horsey, chief executive of Commonweal Housing pointed out that homeless women face a wave of stigma and difficulty accessing services if they do form a relationship with a man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	He said: “While it appears as if a dedicated housing solution for rough sleeping couples is perhaps not the answer, it is clear that existing homelessness services need to be better equipped and supported to deal with rough sleeping couples.”&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;
	The festive season is once again upon us; a time of tradition, or, as it could be more accurately described, of serious imaginative deficit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Take Christmas trees, for example; a particularly heinous tradition for which Prince Albert is to blame. Having brought one to the UK from Germany in 1840, it’s since become customary to uproot over seven million trees a year, and despite their having taken up to ten years to grow, subject them to the cruel fate of being momentarily mocked with garish adornments, before being tossed in the landfill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	And as though the 178-year-old traditions weren’t enough, we now also have to tolerate the newfangled ones. This year the whole rigmarole feels particularly relentless. In London, it’s been weeks since once-favoured pubs succumbed to the nausea-inducing Hygge aesthetic, and cranberries have appeared in almost every supermarket sandwich.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Yet those daring to voice complaints about Christmas are often dubbed a “Scrooge”; a supposed insult that seems a little unfair on Scrooge considering he actually got a lot right about Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Charles Dickens’s character is brilliant because he is the ultimate Christmas straggler, a relatable figure and an inspiration to us all. A “Christmas straggler” is my name for those who find themselves without a fixed tradition at Christmas time. For the straggler, friends with whom you spend the majority of your time deliver the ultimate betrayal by suddenly abandoning you to a newfound tribalism, clannishly retreating to other parts the country to spend time with families you didn’t know they had, or liked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The straggler must instead encroach on another family’s Christmas in order to avoid spending the day alone. Scrooge was very much a Christmas straggler, having spent Christmas eve wandering through his past, present and future with a series of ghosts, before winding up at his nephew’s house on Christmas Day, where he is invited to join their feast. Many of us will have hosted a Christmas straggler or two – a recently divorced work colleague, a neighbour whose family live abroad, a decrepit great aunt sat in the corner who doesn’t seem to belong to anyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Having myself been such a Christmas straggler, I know that it’s a strange position to occupy. Most families have really particular traditions, any deviation from which is considered sacrilege. Navigating these traditions is a minefield. For some, midnight mass is a requirement, while others will balk at the suggestion of spending the countdown to Christmas anywhere but the pub. Are presents before lunchtime, or afterwards? And does the Christmas straggler give and receive presents, or instead look on silently as the other family exchanges their gifts? Feeling alienated by Christmas traditions sucks, but what we can learn from Scrooge is that in many ways, the outsider at Christmas is an enlightened figure, with enough distance from rigidly enforced practices to reflect on them cynically, and potentially reject them altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In Scrooge’s case, his experience as a Christmas straggler teaches him that being stingy and rude makes you unpopular, leading him to break with old habits and learn a new Christmas tradition of charity and benevolence. Scrooge’s personal epiphany played out in the real-life public arena, as a &lt;em&gt;Christmas Carol&lt;/em&gt; is said to capture the zeitgeist of the mid-Victorian revival of the Christmas holiday. The spirit of Christmas described by Dickens lives on today, less recognisable for its charitable content, and more for its emphasis on excessive spending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Waking up on Christmas morning with a renewed generosity, Scrooge embarks on a manic spending splurge that rivals the frenzied behaviour of last-minute Oxford street shoppers, as he excitedly implores the first person he bumps into on Christmas morning to buy a turkey twice the size of a child, described as being so large that it can hardly stand on its own legs “without surely snapping them”. Genetically modified oversized birds remain firmly part of our Christmas tradition, along with Prince Albert’s fir trees, and a lust for spending. Although we’ve retained many of tropes of the Victorian Christmas, the emphasis on charity and community has somewhat diminished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The insistence on secular Christmas rituals that emphasise the importance of nuclear or biological families, and which show no concern for excessive waste, seems more suited to the Victorian period than our own era, where environmentalism is a pressing concern, and families are more diverse and dispersed than ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Scrooge was a pioneer of the Christmas straggler tradition, utilising his position as someone on the fringes of the festivities to re-evaluate the true meaning of a Victorian Christmas, and in doing so became a symbolic figure of social change. The Christmas straggler knows better than most the arbitrariness of certain traditions, and Scrooge has taught us that we have the power to reshape our Christmas present, liberating ourselves from the shackles of past traditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If my happy decision this year to not bother with a tree, or succumb to the pressure of smiling dotingly on the mere mention of anything vaguely Christmas related makes me a Scrooge, that’s fine – it’s a title I’m happy to adopt. &lt;/p&gt;

		 “We used to decorate our house for Christmas every year in Syria. We would put our tree after Saint Barbara Feast Day on 4 December. We believe that Saint Barbara was escaping from her own family after she announced her Christian faith. Below the tree, we would put a crib to illustrate the birth of Jesus.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Nabil Awad, a Kuwait-based architect from Homs, Syria, is remembering his days in Syria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	“Each Christmas, we would go to church for prayers… Each Christmas, my mother would make Turkey and &lt;em&gt;Buche de Noel&lt;/em&gt;, we would drink wine and gather with our family,” he says. “My last Christmas in Syria was in 2011, after we left from Homs to Damascus due to the war. I have never been to Syria since.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Like a living museum, Syria contains many historical churches that do not only reflect the weight of history, and the deep roots of Christianity and its continuity in the region, but also the rich life of different religions in this land. These historical monuments are markers of who we are, where we came from and where we are heading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Eight years into the war in Syria, though, many Syrians, including Christians, have left the country to build a new life in another land. Scattered across the world, the memory of lost times, and Christmases past, still occupy the minds of the Syrian Christian diaspora.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;rtecenter&quot;&gt;
	&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;media-image attr__typeof__foaf:Image img__fid__100734 img__view_mode__media_large attr__format__media_large&quot; height=&quot;1067&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/syrian_christmas.jpg?itok=ZLJ75p07&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nabil Awad with his brother and mother celebrating Christmas in Syria, 1989. Credit: Nabil Awad​&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Ola Saadeh lived in the Old City of Homs.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt; “Local residents used to gather money to light the streets,” she recalls. Many neighbourhoods, as Al-Hamidiyah and al-Mahatta in Homs, would be transformed with the modest and intimate light decorations and Christmas trees. “It felt as if streets were competing to look nicer” she adds. “Our house would not be empty. My father’s friends, who were not Christian, came to greet us for Christmas.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Christmas in pre-war Syria was for many a spiritual and a religious time of the year. Some fasted for 40 days before Christmas, Nataly Trabulsi tells the &lt;em&gt;New Statesman&lt;/em&gt;. Helping the poor was also important. “The entire atmosphere of Christmas in Syria was religious,” Rim Elias, an architect based in Germany, says “Christmas is the time to remember the birth of Jesus Christ, the Savior of the World. It was the time of &lt;em&gt;Ihsan&lt;/em&gt;, time to think of the poor, and support them – without telling anyone that you have made a donation, and without revealing who the donor is.” &lt;i&gt;Ihsan &lt;/i&gt;is an Arabic concept of taking one’s inner faith and showing it in deed and action. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Many Muslim families joined Christmas celebrations in Syria. The family of Sherine Abd Al Samad, a Homsi architect now based in Dubai now, used to put up a tree, and her father would dress up as Santa Claus and give them gifts on Christmas day. Sherine went to the famous Christian school in Homs, Al Ghassaniah Orthodox Private School, which was founded in 1887, and participated in Christmas celebrations each year at school, with gifts, events and decorations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Similarly, Dima Al Habbal, also Muslim, remembers her Christmas time at Al Rahibat School (the Nuns School) in Hama, Syria. “Many Muslims preferred to go to the Christian school.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	“We would all celebrate Christmas together, put the Christmas tree and exchange presents,” Dima says. “For me, it was not a festival for Christians. It was a festival for all of us.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;rtecenter&quot;&gt;
	&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;media-image attr__typeof__foaf:Image img__fid__100735 img__view_mode__media_large attr__format__media_large&quot; height=&quot;560&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/74fbb91c-ecbf-4c5f-99b3-cb8650b677c8.jpg?itok=eNxy4RY-&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sherine Abd Al Samad and her mother, a Syrian Muslim family celebrating Christmas at their home in Homs, Syria, in the 1980s.

&lt;p&gt;
	In exile, where millions of Syrians now reside, Christmas is different, depending on which region they live in. But even though they live now in safety, and are building a new future, many Christians I spoke to expressed their grief and sorrow seeing their own country destroyed. Many of them have been displaced from their own home, often more than once. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	“One night, we packed only the necessary, and left our home in Homs.” Rim Elias says. “We were displaced five times within two years. Then we decided to sell our house in Homs in 2014.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Rim was living in an area that became contested during the early years of conflict. “I miss the simplicity of Christmas in Syria with my family,” she says. While she now lives in Germany, her family is still in Syria. “One year, I did fast the 40 days. On its end, I went to St George’s Church in Homs for prayers, then to my relative’s house who is a &lt;em&gt;Khoury&lt;/em&gt; (priest). The dinner was very simple; eggs, bread and cheese. But their door was open to everyone to come and break their fast. Christmas feels very humane in Syria.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Some Syrian Christians in Western countries love seeing cities decorated for Christmas on such a large scale. But they also highlighted how Christmas feels more commercial and materialistic when compared to Syria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Dana Matouk, who is based in Poland, says she no longer feels Christmassy. “I have not celebrated Christmas last year, nor the year before, nor the one before it. Christmas is being with family and the people you love. I miss the people I left in Syria. I still feel a stranger in Poland.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	These feelings of grief and sadness and the inability to celebrate reflect the individual and collective loss that Syrians have experienced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	“The greatest sadness has not been the destruction of a church or a mosque,” says Dana. “The greatest sadness is our loss since the first bullet was shot in our homeland. The greatest sadness is our homeland.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;rtecenter&quot;&gt;
	&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;media-image attr__typeof__foaf:Image img__fid__100736 img__view_mode__media_large attr__format__media_large&quot; height=&quot;600&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/syrian_christmas_church.jpg?itok=rbXOiTlJ&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Syrian Christians in one of the churches in Homs, Syria. Credit: Dana Matouk.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Christmas is supposed to be a break with the ordinary, but Syrians no longer know what normal is, what an ordinary life is. Each of us has endured so much pain that should be unbearable to carry. Each person I spoke with has their own story, their own suffering that bars them from experiencing simply happiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Ola Saadeh, the Homsi who remembers lights in the street, is now in Germany. She fled fighting in the city in 2012, first to the countryside, and then to Europe. “I went back once to my home in April 2014 to find it destroyed,” she says. “I cried a lot and almost collapsed, I left for Germany and have never been back.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	She adds: “People are trying to get out of the war mode, by putting a tree or Christmas decorations. But if you look inside them, people are really tired, there is no joy to celebrate.” This experience is not just a Christian thing, but one that affects all Syrians, she says. “We have lost the ability to feel Christmas and Eid. But I know, that despite all our loss, as long as there are people, there is life, and it will continue.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Nataly Trabulsi tells the &lt;em&gt;New Statesman &lt;/em&gt;that faces in Homs have changed. “The people that we used to know are no longer there. Some of the churches are still there. But not the people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I write this piece not knowing what the future will hold, and not able to imagine the pain endured by each individual I spoke with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Destruction. Displacement. Exile. Exodus. Bereavement. Separation. Loss. Fears. Disappearance. Christmas is the time to celebrate, but not so much for us drowning in conflicts. I write this piece and think of a future where every Syrian returns to their home, be with their family, and celebrate and build our future together. But I also write this to remember, and in hopes that this memory will be passed through generations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Merry Christmas Syria. Merry Christmas Syrians.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A group of MPs want to stop a no-deal Brexit. But even they can’t agree on an alternative</title>

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;
	My way or the cliff: that’s the decision that Theresa May wants MPs to be contemplating over the Christmas recess. But a group of MPs have a plan to take the weapon out of the Prime Minister’s hands, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/labour-and-tory-rebels-plot-parliamentary-ambush-to-halt-no-deal-brexit-in-new-year_uk_5c1b7ef6e4b0407e90779922?guccounter=1&amp;amp;guce_referrer_us=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;amp;guce_referrer_cs=5iP4LqqHBIA3siU-bY4jmg&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;HuffPo&lt;/em&gt;’s Paul Waugh reveals&lt;/a&gt;: a series of amendments that will “halt” no deal, and the threat that the government could face defeat on non-Brexit matters, including the finance bill, unless May rules out no deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/YvetteCooperMP/status/1075765589908418562&quot;&gt;The first amendment out of the box&lt;/a&gt; – tabled by Yvette Cooper and signed by Nicky Morgan, Hilary Benn, Oliver Letwin, Harriet Harman, Rachel Reeves, and Nick Boles – would prohibit the government from implementing no-deal provisions without the express consent of parliament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There are three things to note here. The first is that while the legislature can prevent the executive from levying taxes and triggering various provisions to make no deal less chaotic and disruptive, the legislature cannot prevent “no deal” by decree any more than I can prevent “no lightbulb” by decree – I have to make a proactive choice to go to the shops and buy another one. The only alternative to a no-deal exit is to agree to something else with the European Union, whether that is the withdrawal agreement or no Brexit at all, neither of which currently commands a parliamentary majority. Absent that, all amendments to limit what the government can do in the event of no deal merely sharpen the rocks at the bottom of the ravine – they increase rather than decrease May’s leverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The second is that even within the seven signatories to Cooper’s amendment there is division about which path to take forward to resolve the crisis. Morgan, Letwin and Boles all favour a close relationship with the European Union after Brexit that looks a lot like the EEA, and all three plan to vote for the withdrawal agreement to facilitate that. Benn, too, wants an EEA-style final relationship but as it stands will vote against the withdrawal agreement because the current political declaration positions us away from an EEA-type arrangement not towards it. Reeves is in favour of a second referendum. Cooper has called for Article 50 to be extended to allow more time for discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The third is that it illuminates a crucial difference between parliament’s Remainers and its Brexiteers. For the most part, devoted Brexiteers, particularly on the Conservative benches, have spent most if not all of their careers on the backbenches, and those who have held ministerial office have, with a few exceptions, mostly not had much of a grip on how their departments run. For the most part, Westminster’s organised Remainers have spent almost all of their parliamentary careers on the frontbench and their amendments tend to rely on a degree of sympathetic interpretation, or at least not the out-and-out intransigence that May prefers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There are some measures that parliament could take that would take no deal off the table – for instance, as &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JolyonMaugham/status/1075800799362592768&quot;&gt;Jo Maugham suggests&lt;/a&gt;, by voting through a motion that if an accord has not been reached by exit day, the United Kingdom will revoke Article 50. But as Maugham also rightly notes, that motion might be passable after February 2019 – it isn’t passable now. And it’s much more likely that if it looks like no agreement will be reached in February then MPs will vote for May’s deal, rather than no deal or no Brexit at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But the problem is that the withdrawal agreement is merely the United Kingdom’s first close encounter with the cliff edge. This divided and fractious parliament is going to have to reach an accord on extending the transition period, or if you are feeling wildly optimistic, about the final free trade agreement. The same fraught parliamentary arithmetic will still apply, unless that it is, another election returns a significantly different parliament, or another referendum returns a different result to the last one.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--

	General Jim Mattis, the US secretary of defense, who announced his resignation late Thursday night, always hated the nickname “Mad Dog”. He may have been a general in the elite US Marine Corps, with an illustrious combat record, but he was also a scholarly figure, with a reported 7,000-volume library that he took with him on every tour of duty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In fact, during his tenure heading the Pentagon, Mattis developed such a reputation as a thoughtful, sober operator that the hot-headed Donald Trump satirised his nickname dismissively, taking to mocking him by calling him “Moderate Dog.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The announcement of his resignation, which came late Thursday evening, was not surprising to many in the Washington establishment. Mattis and the president had clashed this week over US troop deployment to Syria and Afghanistan: on Thursday, against the advice of his military staff, including Mattis, Trump announced that he would be withdrawing US troops from Syria, and also indicated that his administration was making plans to pull US forces from Afghanistan as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This appears to have been the final straw for Mattis. In his resignation letter, which is all the more excoriating for its subtlety, Mattis said: “Because you have the right to a Secretary of Defense whose views are more aligned with yours … I believe it is right for me to step down from my position.” He would be leaving the Defense Department on February 28, 2019, he announced in his letter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In quiet paragraphs that stop just short of criticising the president directly, but whose subtext is unmistakably critical of Trump’s approach to foreign policy, Mattis wrote that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
		“One core belief I have always held is that our strength as a nation is inextricably linked to the strength of our unique and comprehensive system of alliances and partnerships. While the US remains the indispensable nation in the free world, we cannot protect our interests or serve that role effectively without maintaining strong alliances and showing respect to those allies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	You can read the letter in full &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/world/north-america/2018/12/full-us-defense-secretary-jim-mattis-resignation-letter&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	***&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	You do not have to read between the lines too closely in the letter to see that Mattis believes that Trump is showing catastrophic lack of respect to those international alliances which he describes. As the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;’ Maggie Haberman &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/maggieNYT/status/1075885926151348226&quot;&gt;describes it&lt;/a&gt;, the letter represents “an astonishing rebuke of Trumpism”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In withdrawing troops from Afghanistan and Syria, Trump clearly hopes for a domestic political victory. His bizarre announcement, coming in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1075397797929775105&quot;&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday, that “We have defeated Isis in Syria, my only reason for being there during the Trump presidency,” shocked many of his miltary aides, including Mattis, as well as America’s international allies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Florence Parly, the French minister for the armed forces, tweeted that Isis “had not been cleared off the map, nor, for that matter, have its roots been cleared.” On Thursday, UK defence secretary Gavin Williamson also contradicted Trump’s claims, saying that “much hard work still lies ahead to ensure we win the war.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Doubling down, Trump then tweeted: “Does the USA want to be the Policeman of the Middle East, getting NOTHING but spending precious lives and trillions of dollars protecting others who, in almost all cases, do not appreciate what we are doing?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	“Do we want to be there forever?” he added. “Time for others to finally fight.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The withdrawal decision is also a big win for Vladimir Putin, the &lt;em&gt;Washington Post &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/trumps-withdrawal-from-syria-marks-a-win-for-putin/2018/12/20/59c685e8-0491-11e9-b5df-5d3874f1ac36_story.html?utm_term=.3d76ef06db8c&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;. Of course it is: it leaves the regime of the murderous dictator Bashar al-Assad, who has used chemical weapons to massacre his own people over the course of the brutal years-long civil war, free to return to its status of Russian client-state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This seems to have been the final straw for Mattis, who becomes the last of the generals Trump appointed to his cabinet to step down – a group which included General John Kelly, who is stepping down as White House chief of staff at the end of this year, and General Michael Flynn, who is currently &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/world/north-america/2018/12/general-flynn-lock-her-guy-not-going-jail-means-mueller-s-trap-closing&quot;&gt;awaiting sentencing&lt;/a&gt; after pleading guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russian officials during the campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Mattis has clashed with Trump over many issues during his tenure at the Pentagon. He publicly split from the president over several issues, including Trump’s announcement that transgender people would not be allowed to serve in the military (a policy which Trump tweeted but which the Department of Defense, lacking direct orders, simply did not enact) and Trump’s withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal. He seemed to have managed to find a style which avoided direct confrontation with the president and even managed to change Trump’s mind on the subject of the efficacy of torture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When Mattis met Trump for the first time during the transition at the end of 2016 Trump asked him: “What do you think of waterboarding?”, according to an &lt;a href=&quot;https://edition.cnn.com/2016/11/23/politics/waterboarding-trump-mattis/index.html&quot;&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; Trump later gave &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;. Mattis’ response, which Trump said surprised him, was: “I’ve never found it to be useful,” adding “I’ve always found that if you give me a pack of cigarettes and a couple of beers and I do better with that than I do with torture.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	That this actually changed Trump’s mind on the subject is a rare and surprising event – Trump rarely, if ever, changes his mind on anything – and it cemented Mattis’ image not just as one of the grown ups in the room, but also as almost a Trump-whisperer, someone with the almost unique gift in the administration of being able to redirect the president away from his more dangerous misconceptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It is unclear who Mattis’ successor will be, but it seems extremely unlikely that whoever it is will have this gift. In fact, with the Mueller investigation closing in around Trump, it seems more likely that he would pick a loyalist and toady, rather than an experienced and clear-headed operator, to head the world’s largest military force. Trump has already, despite Mattis’ influence, discovered that he can use the US military for political purposes: in the run-up to November’s midterm elections he deployed more than 5,000 US troops to America’s Southern border in order to whip up fears of the non-existent dangers of a “caravan” of migrants approaching the US from Central America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It seems likely that such stunts – as well as, perhaps, even more dangerous uses of the US military – will become more common now that one of the administration’s steadier hands is departing. In the meantime, it leaves National Security Advisor John Bolton – a much more hawkish and less thoughtful operator with some dangerously hardline views who has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/world/north-america/2018/03/john-bolton-chilling-finale-week-s-episode-trump-s-insane-reality-show&quot;&gt;previously called for&lt;/a&gt;, among other things, pre-emptive nuclear strikes against North Korea and who, unlike Mattis, is a hardline opponent of the Iran nuclear deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Without Mattis, Bolton is now, to all intents and purposes, in sole charge of the world’s most powerful military force. That should trouble us all.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;
	Dear Mr. President:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I have been privileged to serve as our country’s 26th Secretary of Defense which has allowed me to serve alongside our men and women at the Department in defense of our citizens and our ideals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I am proud of the progress that has been made over the past two years on some of the key goals articulated in our National Defense Strategy: putting the department on a more sound budgetary footing, improving readiness and lethality in our forces, and reforming the Department’s business practices for greater performance. Our troops continue to provide the capabilities needed to prevail in conflict and sustain strong US global influence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One core belief I have always held is that our strength as a nation is inextricably linked to the strength of our unique and comprehensive system of alliances and partnerships. While the US remains the indispensable nation of the free world, we cannot protect our interests or serve that role effectively without maintaining strong alliances and showing respect to those allies. Like you, I have said from the beginning that the armed forces of the United States should not be the policeman of the world. Instead, we must use all the tools of American power to provide for the common defense, including providing effective leadership to our alliances. NATO’s 29 democracies demonstrated that strength in their commitment to fighting alongside us following the 9-11 attack on America. The Defeat-ISIS coalition of 74 nations is further proof.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Similarly, I believe we must be resolute and unambiguous in our approach to those countries whose strategic interests are increasingly in tension with ours. It is clear that China and Russia, for example, want to shape a world consistent with their authoritarian model – gaining veto authority over other nations’ economic, diplomatic, and security decisions – to promote their own interests at the expense of their neighbours, America and our allies. That is why we must use all the tools of American power to provide for the common defense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	My views on treating allies with respect and also being clear-eyed about both malign actors and strategic competitors are strongly held and informed by over four decades of immersion in these issues. We must do everything possible to advance an international order that is most conducive to our security, prosperity and values, and we are strengthened in this effort by the solidarity of our alliances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Because you have a right to have a Secretary of Defense whose views are better aligned with yours on these and other subjects, I believe it is right for me to step down from my position. The end date for my tenure is Febuary 28, 2019, a date that should allow sufficient time for a successor to be nominated and confirmed as well as to ensure that the Department’s interests are properly articulated and protected at upcoming events to include Congressional posture hearings and the NATO Defense Ministerial meeting in February. Further, that a full transition to a new Secretary of Defense occurs well in advance of the transition of Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in September in order to ensure stability within the Department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I pledge my full effort to a smooth transition that ensures the needs and interests of 2.15 million Service Members and 732, 079 DoD civilians receive undistracted attention of the Department at all times so that they can fulfill their critical, round-the-clock mission to protect the American people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I very much appreciate this opportunity to serve the nation and our men and women in uniform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Jim Mattis.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>To understand Trump’s America, read John Steinbeck</title>

	“His book is a lie, a black, infernal creation of a twisted, distorted mind.” It was a Democratic representative from Oklahoma who gave this verdict of The Grapes of Wrath, John Steinbeck’s chronicle of migrants leaving the Dust Bowl for California. Disdained by the political elite and much of the literary set, it was nonetheless the best-selling book of 1939.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Today’s parallels with the 1930s give Steinbeck’s work renewed urgency. He writes about farm labourers, shopkeepers and the denizens of village taverns – the kinds of people who, before the enormous political upheaval of 2016, the chattering classes barely remembered. In the age of Trump, mass-migration and the phenomenon of the ‘left behind’, Steinbeck’s work is just as relevant as when he wrote it. But more than that: reading Steinbeck fifty years after his death is the perfect antidote to the culture war that has gripped America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As in the 1930s, machinery – today it’s automation – threaten traditional livelihoods and ways of life in the United States. The Rust Belt is today’s version of the Dust Bowl of the Depression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	“One man on a tractor can take the place of twelve or fourteen families,” representatives of city-based corporations explain to the tenant families working the Oklahoma land in The Grapes of Wrath. Unconcerned by the fabric of local communities, the agents suggest the families abandon their homes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	“Why don’t you go west to California? … You can reach out anywhere and pick an orange,” they advise, incentivising migration, like the local authorities today who pack homeless people on buses and send them to other American cities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Steinbeck tried significantly harder to understand the plight of migrant workers, spending weeks travelling with them in California and producing journalism that highlighted their plight. The stories they told him led to The Grapes of Wrath, published in 1939. Today, it would be hard to read the novel without thinking of another caravan of migrants making headlines by trying to reach California. Like Steinbeck’s Midwesterners, they pine for a promised land of economic security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If California is Steinbeck country, it is not the California many readers recognise from popular culture. His locale is not Los Angeles or San Francisco, but Salinas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It was “never a pretty town,” wrote Steinbeck in an article in 1955. “The mountains on both sides of the valley were beautiful, but Salinas was not, and we knew it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Salinas Valley is to Steinbeck what London is to Dickens, or the American West to Cormac McCarthy. That the ordinary people of the Salinas Valley were Steinbeck’s muses says much about his position in America’s urban-rural divide. In Steinbeck’s time this divide fed his critics’ disdain. Today it is arguably the most important fissure in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Born into a family of moderate resources, Steinbeck was a writer, a journalist, and a sporadic attendee of Stanford University. But he was a long way from being an urbanite. None of his major works are set in a big city and few of his characters have metropolitan pretensions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An exception is the disastrously naïve Adam Trask from East of Eden, a holier-than-thou liberal who subscribes to the East Coast titles &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;National Geographic&lt;/em&gt;. And when Adam’s business venture to transport ice-packed lettuce eastwards from central California ruins him financially, Steinbeck gives us an archetypically small-town American perspective on the hubristically over-educated and self-righteous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	“These know-it-all dreamers always got into trouble…People who inherited their money always got into trouble.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It seems strange that a writer with a Pulitzer and a Nobel prize is a window into the allegedly philistine side of the culture war. But Steinbeck was not appreciated by the literary establishment. He was not as experimental as Faulkner, not as sophisticated as Fitzgerald, not as high-brow as James.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Perhaps it’s that Steinbeck is too easy to read, not complicated enough to warrant a place in the pantheon. His prose may be simple, but it is also lyrical, most notably in the descriptions of setting that begin so many chapters and novels, from the eponymous street in Cannery Row to the Salinas River in Of Mice and Men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Or perhaps it’s because he writes about ordinary folk. Whether it was peasants in the Soviet Union in his brilliant travelogue The Russian Journal, or his fictionalised farm labourers of the Salinas Valley, Steinbeck was forever drawn to salt-of-the-earth characters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Defending himself during his Nobel Prize speech in 1962 he affirmed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	“Literature was not promulgated by a pale and emasculated critical priesthood singing their litanies in empty churches – nor is it a game for the cloistered elect, the tinhorn mendicants of low calorie despair … The skalds, the bards, the writers are not separate and exclusive.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When we consider the culture war today, Steinbeck’s earthy approach to literature demonstrates the value of a strong connection between the intelligentsia and the common man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A particularly uncommon man currently sits in the White House. Steinbeck, grounded in rural and blue-collar life, would see the appeal of Trump. But he would also see that Trump is not the answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Steinbeck’s oeuvre contains a few characters with Trumpian traits. It might be tempting to find a parallel with the inferiority-complexed and confrontational Curley from Of Mice and Men, the landowner’s son whose pride pushes the novella’s calamity, but the real Trump is Cyrus Trask, the irascible patriarch from East of Eden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Spinning fabricated tales, Trask senior rises to become a powerful official in the postbellum government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	“At the very first he knew he was lying,” Steinbeck’s narrator tells us, “but it was not long before he was equally sure that every one of his stories was true.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Once in the corridors of power, Cyrus cuts an aggressive, intimidating figure: “I can get senators defeated and I can pick appointments like apples. I can make men and I can destroy men.” Read today, he even sounds like Trump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To be sure, The Grapes of Wrath and East of Eden are too long, many of Steinbeck’s characters (particularly the female ones) are oversimplified, and the contemporary critics who charged him with moralising sometimes had a point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But migrant workers are still struggling to make a living in the fields, there is no long-term solution to the future of blue-collar work, and the weather – be it dust, drought or fire – is still wreaking havoc on rural communities. Steinbeck still has a place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The day before the Swedish Academy honoured Steinbeck in 1962, a &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; headline asked: “Does a Writer with a Moral Vision of the 1930s Deserve the Nobel Prize?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With that assessment, is it any wonder reading Steinbeck in our own age feels so important?&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--

    <title>MPs need more than amendments if they want to stop a no-deal Brexit</title>
    <link>https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/staggers/2018/12/mps-need-more-amendments-if-they-want-stop-no-deal-brexit</link>

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt; &lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	Can parliament stop a no-deal Brexit? The working assumption of what you might call the mushy middle of both Labour and Conservative MPs is yes, and they have ended this parliamentary term with a preview of how they intend to spend the next trying to do just that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	Yvette Cooper, Nicky Morgan, Oliver Letwin, Hilary Benn, Nick Boles and Harriet Harman have tabled an amendment to the finance bill, due back before the Commons on 8 January, which would make government spending on no-deal measures illegal without parliament’s explicit consent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	As we are constantly reminded, there is no majority in the Commons for leaving without a deal, so if passed, the amendment would prevent ministers from funding and thus implementing the measures necessary to mitigate the impact of no-deal. Cooper describes it as a means to rule out a cliff-edge rupture with Brussels and then “look at every other legislative opportunity too”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	But that itself isn’t enough to declare a mission accomplished: in the absence of that clear majority agreeing something else, then the practical function of that amendment is like that of an aeroplane lifejacket whose inflation is conditional on a majority of passengers agreeing that they want the plane to crash. What MPs cannot do by fiat or legislative tinkering is change the fact that the crash is happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	Similarly, by calling for the opportunity to “look at” alternative avenues for stopping a no deal, Cooper is essentially asking for MPs to get more time to disagree on what Brexit model they want. The majority against no deal in the Commons is much like the one that probably exists for stopping world hunger: the ends will always be aspirational unless you can get Priti Patel and Stephen Twigg to agree on the means, which you can’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	That is also the fundamental problem with the logic of those MPs who tell the&lt;em&gt; Huffington Post &lt;/em&gt;that they are planning a parliamentary guerrilla war to avert a no-deal scenario by tabling further such amendments to Brexit legislation that would aim to extend or revoke Article 50 or legislate for a second referendum. Other suggestions include taking the nuclear option of refusing to approve spending for Whitehall departments in a bid to make the business of government impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	We already know that the Prime Minister’s lack of a majority can be weaponised to derail what little is left of its domestic agenda to express dissatisfaction with their direction of travel on Brexit. The DUP and more doctrinaire end of the European Research Group have been doing so for months, which is no small part of the reason why May has postponed the meaningful vote in search of an Irish border compromise to buy them off with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Simply aping that tactic in the hope of avoiding a no-deal can at best only be the start of a process that applies enough political pressure for the government and MPs to actively choose to do something else that stops it. Unless, as 29 March looms larger, minds are focused and compromises reached, these amendments are displacement activity. In the absence of another agreed solution, no deal remains the default.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;
	Ivan Lewis, the Labour MP for Bury South has resigned from the Labour Party, citing the handling of allegations of sexual harassment against him and anti-Semitism in the Labour Party &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JewishTelegraph/status/1075789517779599361&quot;&gt;as the grounds for his decision&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As far as Labour’s handling of allegations of sexual harassment go, it is another embarrassing failure for the party’s creaking processes. Three Labour MPs have had the whip suspended pending investigation of such claims: Luton North MP and longstanding Corbyn-ally, Kelvin Hopkins, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jan/12/labour-steps-up-inquiry-into-complaints-against-mp-kelvin-hopkins&quot;&gt;suspended in January 2018&lt;/a&gt;, Barrow and Furness MP John Woodcock, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/apr/30/labour-suspends-john-woodcock-over-sexual-harassment-claim&quot;&gt;suspended in April 2018&lt;/a&gt;, and Lewis, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/nov/23/labour-suspends-ex-minister-ivan-lewis-over-sexual-harassment-claim&quot;&gt;suspended in November 2017&lt;/a&gt;, of whom the latter two are both Corbyn critics. All three men deny the allegations. None of the cases has been resolved, and now both Woodcock and Lewis have walked out of the Labour Party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Lewis, like Woodcock, has said that he is happy to co-operate with a “truly independent process” to manage their allegations. Woodcock said in his resignation letter that he “will now seek to refer myself to an independent process”, but as yet, no such process has been set up and it is not clear that that one ever will be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	What does it mean for the still ongoing question of when, and how big, any organised breakaway from the Labour Party would be? As with Woodcock, Lewis has also blasted the Labour leadership’s failure to tackle anti-Semitism in its ranks, and like Woodcock, he has accused Jeremy Corbyn of an “anti-Western” worldview. These are sentiments that are shared by a number of Labour MPs who are not themselves the subject of ongoing investigations of sexual harassment, and even those MPs with doubts about the messenger will find it hard to entirely ignore the message.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;
	A few weeks ago, &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScqiHicJXPCWPZVXKdhyPTO9jHFgdXV08WdA6nPf0_k2j5Xvw/closedform&quot;&gt;a petition began to circulate&lt;/a&gt;. Noah Carl, a Cambridge academic who had recently been awarded a prestigious scholarship, was accused of promoting “racist pseudoscience” for the benefit of the far right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Almost immediately, media commentators leapt to Carl’s defence. The petition was a &lt;a href=&quot;https://quillette.com/2018/12/07/academics-mobbing-of-a-young-scholar-must-be-denounced/&quot;&gt;“witch-hunt”&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2018/12/will-noah-carl-get-a-fair-hearing/&quot;&gt;“mob”&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://quillette.com/2018/12/07/academics-mobbing-of-a-young-scholar-must-be-denounced/&quot;&gt;“academic McCarthyism”&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/12/07/the-new-science-left-wing-academics-hound-cambridge-scholar-for-wrongthink/&quot;&gt;Snowflake students and their Marxist academic handlers,&lt;/a&gt; it was alleged, had once again labelled an honest conservative as “racist” without reading their work. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/cambridge-professor-eugenics-research-investigation-racism-london-conference-intelligence-a8672921.html&quot;&gt;Carl told the &lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/cambridge-professor-eugenics-research-investigation-racism-london-conference-intelligence-a8672921.html&quot;&gt;Independent&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/i&gt;he would not be commenting publicly on the petition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Carl’s defenders didn’t need to look into the claims made by the petition. A cursory glance at his mainstream academic work was enough to see that what students and academics were upset over was simply uncomfortable scientific truths and a man willing to debate them robustly. It was clear: Carl was just another martyr for free speech. The latest casualty in the long march of student totalitarianism. Or so they claimed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Like many in the academic far-right, Noah Carl lives a double-life. Research for mainstream, established journals serves to legitimate the pseudoscience that he produces in his spare time. This extracurricular work, for the online journal &lt;em&gt;OpenPsych&lt;/em&gt;, is where Carl really takes on the tough questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Take his attempt to deal with the causes of racist stereotypes – a difficult topic in need of thorough, thoughtful debate. Following an observational study with a sample size of 23 nationalities, he &lt;a href=&quot;https://openpsych.net/files/papers/Carl_2016b.pdf&quot;&gt;argued that racist stereotypes are “reasonably accurate”.&lt;/a&gt; The only person to review this article outside of &lt;em&gt;OpenPsych &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.healthgeomatics.com/award-winner-in-dumb-research/&quot;&gt;concluded by stating&lt;/a&gt;: “It is never OK to publish research this bad.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Or take his &lt;a href=&quot;https://openpsych.net/paper/9&quot;&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://openpsych.net/paper/52&quot;&gt;attempts&lt;/a&gt; to deal with the connection between Muslim immigration and terrorism – an inflammatory topic when dealt with even by the most conscientious of researchers. Among the sources Carl used for his data was &lt;a href=&quot;https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-religion-of-peace/&quot;&gt;TheReligionOfPeace.com&lt;/a&gt;, an Islamophobic conspiracy website that was cited four times in the manifesto of Anders Breivik, a &lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: small;&quot;&gt;Norwegian far-right terrorist&lt;/span&gt;. Unsurprisingly, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thereligionofpeace.com/pages/site/the-list.aspx&quot;&gt;the data uses a broad criteria, which includes domestic violence and robbery&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;OpenPsych&lt;/em&gt; is a pseudoscience factory-farm, and Noah Carl is its prize hen. He is its second most prolific contributor, a member of the review team and its only Russell Group academic. Half of Carl’s &lt;em&gt;OpenPsych&lt;/em&gt; reviews have come from just two people, one of whom, Emil Kirkegaard, has no educational qualifications &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/emil-ole-william-kirkegaard-39569579/&quot;&gt;beyond a Bachelor’s degree in linguistics&lt;/a&gt;, according to his own LinkedIn page. Kirkegaard also happens to be the founder of &lt;em&gt;OpenPsych&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Kirkegaard is a maverick when it comes to scientific ethics. In 2016, he and Julius Bjerrekær (&lt;em&gt;OpenPsych&lt;/em&gt;’s third most prolific author, behind Kirkegaard and Carl) were responsible &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/2016/5/12/11666116/70000-okcupid-users-data-release&quot;&gt;for what one social scientist described&lt;/a&gt; as “without a doubt one of the most grossly unprofessional, unethical and reprehensible data releases I have ever seen.” The two had leaked the private data of 70,000 OKCupid users, including their personal sexual preferences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	That Noah Carl’s articles never got close to serious scrutiny didn’t stop them from spreading online. One of the studies on Muslims ended up on a far-right website under the headline: &lt;a href=&quot;https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;amp;sl=fi&amp;amp;u=https://www.nykysuomi.com/2017/05/26/tutkimus-islamistivakivallan-syyt-paljastuivat/&amp;amp;prev=search&quot;&gt;“Research: The Causes of Islamic Violence Uncovered!&lt;/a&gt;” The study on immigration was summarised by far-right Free West Media &lt;a href=&quot;http://freewestmedia.com/2016/11/25/migrants-that-britons-do-not-want-happen-to-be-criminal-study-shows/&quot;&gt;as showing that “criminal elements are represented by certain ethnicities.”&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;InfoWars&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.infowars.com/these-immigrants-commit-more-crime-in-the-u-k-and-britons-want-their-numbers-reduced/&quot;&gt;chose the headline&lt;/a&gt;: “These immigrants commit more crime in the UK and Britons want their numbers reduced,” while a French far-right politician went for the more succinct &lt;a href=&quot;https://henrydelesquen.fr/2017/01/27/immigres-la-science-valide-les-prejuges/&quot;&gt;“Study Validates Prejudices.”&lt;/a&gt; In most cases, Noah Carl’s then position at Oxford University was quoted approvingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This is not unusual for &lt;em&gt;OpenPsych &lt;/em&gt;papers – in fact, it’s the norm. &lt;em&gt;OpenPsych &lt;/em&gt;is not simply a few undergraduates who skipped their methods classes, but a central node in a dense network of race scientists who work to provide legitimacy and propaganda for the far-right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Earlier this year, I &lt;a href=&quot;https://londonstudent.coop/exposed-london-eugenics-conferences-neo-nazi-links/&quot;&gt;uncovered that UCL was unwittingly hosting a secret annual conference on racial eugenics&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;London Conference on Intelligence &lt;/em&gt;(LCI). The LCI was, I discovered, part of a wider network of eugenicists centred around the notorious &lt;em&gt;Mankind Quarterly&lt;/em&gt; and its backer, the &lt;em&gt;Pioneer Fund&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/pioneer-fund&quot;&gt;which was established with the aim of promoting “race betterment” through selective breeding and racial segregation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;OpenPsych &lt;/em&gt;is another cog in this machine. Of the top 15 &lt;em&gt;OpenPsych&lt;/em&gt; contributors, 11 have written for &lt;em&gt;Mankind Quarterly&lt;/em&gt; in the past three years. Of these, nine were also speakers at the &lt;em&gt;London Conference on Intelligence&lt;/em&gt;, including &lt;em&gt;Mankind Quarterly &lt;/em&gt;editor Gerhard Meisenberg, &lt;em&gt;Pioneer Fund &lt;/em&gt;president Richard Lynn and Noah Carl himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Among the papers he has approved for publication on &lt;em&gt;OpenPsych&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://openpsych.net/files/papers/Kirkegaard_2017a.pdf&quot;&gt;are those linking race and criminality&lt;/a&gt;, including one &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.openpsych.net/forum/showthread.php?tid=302&quot;&gt;which concludes by suggesting&lt;/a&gt;: “Muslims immigrants have values that are disharmonious with those of people living in Western countries […] resulting in crime against the native population.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;OpenPsych&lt;/em&gt; also has more direct links to the far-right. The Pioneer Fund is known in the USA for bankrolling the white supremacist group &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ferris-pages.org/ISAR/Institut/pioneer/search.htm&quot;&gt;American Renaissance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, whose conferences have hosted former British National Party leader Nick Griffin, white nationalist Richard Spencer and former Ku Klux Klan Grand Wizard David Duke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One frequent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amren.com/author/peter-brimelow/&quot;&gt;contributor&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;em&gt;American Renaissance&lt;/em&gt;, Peter Brimelow, &lt;a href=&quot;https://vdare.com/solicitations/say-no-to-censorship-say-yes-to-patriotic-immigration-reform&quot;&gt;runs&lt;/a&gt; the white nationalist website VDARE, to which &lt;a href=&quot;https://vdare.com/writers/edward-dutton&quot;&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;OpenPsych&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://vdare.com/writers/richard-lynn&quot;&gt;regulars&lt;/a&gt; have contributed. &lt;a href=&quot;http://propertyandfreedom.org/past-speakers/&quot;&gt;Two have spoken&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;at the crackpot libertarian Property and Freedom Society, while Richard Lynn was &lt;a href=&quot;https://traditionalbritain.org/events/traditional-britain-conference-2018/&quot;&gt;roped&lt;/a&gt; into this year’s conference of the far-right Traditional Britain Group, after the organiser of the &lt;em&gt;London Conference on Intelligence&lt;/em&gt; pulled out due to press attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	“Totalitarianism doesn’t always come wearing jackboots,” &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/dan-hannan-the-totalitarian-university&quot;&gt;thundered Daniel Hannan in the &lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/dan-hannan-the-totalitarian-university&quot;&gt;Washington Examiner&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;– referring, of course, to the petition rather than white supremacists. Toby Young promised that he would be &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2018/12/the-scandalous-shaming-of-noah-carl/&quot;&gt;“leading the fightback against the Maoist Left,”&lt;/a&gt; which was unsurprising coming from someone &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dcscience.net/Toby-Young-2018-Intelligence.pdf&quot;&gt;who compared his own attendance&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;em&gt;London Conference on Intelligence&lt;/em&gt; with being part of Hungarian human rights activist Václav Havel’s Charter 77.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Amidst all the grandstanding, not one of these pundits appear to have bothered to look into the veracity of the allegations against Noah Carl, content instead to join the moral panic over campus censorship. Not one mentioned that the petition had been a last-resort by students &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.varsity.co.uk/news/16698&quot;&gt;who could not get the University to conduct an investigation through private complaints&lt;/a&gt;, content instead to accuse them of &lt;a href=&quot;https://quillette.com/2018/12/07/academics-mobbing-of-a-young-scholar-must-be-denounced/&quot;&gt;“academic mobbing.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This is not genuine outrage at the erosion of academic freedom. After all, Toby Young’s short-lived position on the Office for Students was in part &lt;a href=&quot;https://publicappointmentscommissioner.independent.gov.uk/report-appointments-board-office-students/&quot;&gt;because he toed the line on the government’s anti-free speech Prevent agenda&lt;/a&gt; (other candidates were disqualified for being opposed).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The media has a problem with students. Maybe it’s because students are a modern folk-devil, portrayed as simultaneously buffoonish and deadly, like Muslims&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/586742/European-Union-barmy-decisions-rules-regulations-Britain-EU&quot;&gt; or bendy bananas&lt;/a&gt;. Or maybe it’s because nothing is more bruising to the ego of certain politicians and pundits than to see students and academics refuse to tolerate the same gutter racism that thrives in their own institutions.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--

    <title>The United Kingdom’s homelessness crisis is a predictable consequence of government policy</title>
    <link>https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/staggers/2018/12/united-kingdom-s-homelessness-crisis-predictable-consequence-government</link>

	Since 2010 the government has made two choices: to cut public spending and to make sure that those cuts don’t touch Tory voters.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-node-image field-type-image field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;noscript class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoints=&quot;300 768 1024&quot; data-adaptive-image-300-img=&quot;&amp;lt;img class=&amp;quot;adaptive-image&amp;quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&amp;quot;300&amp;quot; typeof=&amp;quot;foaf:Image&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2018/12/gettyimages-109787921.jpg?itok=fP4rr7FA&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;George Osborne holds a pound coin.&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&quot; data-adaptive-image-768-img=&quot;&amp;lt;img class=&amp;quot;adaptive-image&amp;quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&amp;quot;768&amp;quot; typeof=&amp;quot;foaf:Image&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2018/12/gettyimages-109787921.jpg?itok=fP4rr7FA&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;George Osborne holds a pound coin.&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&quot; data-adaptive-image-1024-img=&quot;&amp;lt;img class=&amp;quot;adaptive-image&amp;quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&amp;quot;1024&amp;quot; typeof=&amp;quot;foaf:Image&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2018/12/gettyimages-109787921.jpg?itok=fP4rr7FA&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;George Osborne holds a pound coin.&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&quot; data-adaptive-image-max-img=&quot;&amp;lt;img class=&amp;quot;adaptive-image&amp;quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&amp;quot;max&amp;quot; typeof=&amp;quot;foaf:Image&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2018/12/gettyimages-109787921.jpg?itok=fP4rr7FA&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;George Osborne holds a pound coin.&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&quot;&gt;&lt;img typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2018/12/gettyimages-109787921.jpg?itok=fP4rr7FA&quot; alt=&quot;George Osborne holds a pound coin.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;
	For the second time this year, one of the people sleeping rough outside the entrance to the Tube station by the Houses of Parliament has died. Both were men: which is what we’d expect as men are more likely to end up sleeping rough and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/deathsofhomelesspeopleinenglandandwales/2013to2017&quot;&gt;84 per cent of the estimated 597 homeless people who died in 2017 were men&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Gyula Remes was close to the statistical average of a dead homeless person: 43 years old, living in a city centre, and working. His death is surprising only because it underlines the extent of the government’s political failure over rough sleeping: that the Conservative government can’t even get to grips with the problem when it happens under a Tory-run local authority in a location where it causes maximum political embarrassment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	James Brokenshire, the Secretary of State for Communities, Local Government and Housing, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/dec/18/rising-homelessness-is-not-due-to-tory-policies-says-james-brokenshire&quot;&gt;tried to claim this week&lt;/a&gt; that the rise in rough sleeping since 2010 – the homelessness charity Crisis estimates that it has increased by 98 per cent since the Conservatives took office – was down not to government policy but to problems of drug addiction, family breakdown and LGBT teenagers and young people being kicked out by homophobic relatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	These are all undoubtedly issues that help exacerbate homelessness – both in terms of people who end up sleeping rough in cars, on the streets or in tents and in terms of the “hidden homeless”, that is to say, people sleeping on sofas and otherwise moving between the kindness of friends and co-workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It’s true that many of the hidden homeless tend to be one half of a separating couple, where one half of the relationship, usually but not always the man, moves out of the shared home, starts sleeping at friends or on the sofa. Sometimes, these people then move from sofa-surfing to rough sleeping, due to falling out with the people they stay with, embarrassment at taking so long to get back on their feet, or for other reasons. Sometimes, family breakdown can lead to a new partner falling out with, or actively forcing out, the teenage children of their new partner, who end up on the streets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It is true, too, to say that issues of addiction are part of why people move from sofa-surfing to rough sleeping, though it is also true to say that many people become drug addicts – largely to legal highs like cut-price beer rather than illegal highs – on the streets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	And it is also true that when young people come out to their parents they risk violence, eviction or other threats that may lead to those young people ending up on the streets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But it strains credulity to beyond breaking point to claim that a LGBT teenager became &lt;em&gt;more &lt;/em&gt;likely to be evicted from their parents’ home just as our government’s hue changed from red to blue. Family breakdown has in fact continued its long-term decline under the Tories as it did under the last Labour government: it has not become more likely. While relationships do end, drug addiction does happen, and homophobic attitudes remain rife in society, you cannot support the claim that there has been a coincidental rise in homophobia-driven evictions and domestic splits that exactly coincides with cuts to housing benefit and rising rents while having no detectable statistical presence elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The truth – which we can clearly see in the tangible measures the government is now finally taking to belatedly fix the mess it has made – is that the rise in rough sleeping is the entirely predictable consequence not only of the decision taken to try to balance the books in a single parliamentary term but the decisions taken about how to do that: which was, particularly from 2010 to 2016, to cut public spending in ways that largely fell on people who did not vote Conservative or because they have chaotic lives, do not vote at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	That involved what Polly Toynbee called “devolving the axe”: cutting local government funding, and local governments have largely concentrated on fulfilling their legal obligations and avoiding the most politically painful cuts. This once again meant that the hardest hit were people with very acute needs – because if your need is more acute, government may need to spend more money on you, but you still ultimately have only one vote. That, too, exacerbated the homelessness crisis. We can see that this has had a direct effect because, surprise surprise, the extra money announced by Brokenshire is ring-fenced to prevent it being used elsewhere. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Deaths among rough sleepers, like Remes’s, are more likely to happen in extreme weather, something the government cannot control. But ultimately, the conditions that lead to people sleeping rough are not like the weather: they are within the control of the government.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--

    <title>Britain’s unpopularity contest: the year in polling</title>
    <link>https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/staggers/2018/12/britain-s-unpopularity-contest-year-polling</link>

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;
	After two general elections in which polling is not thought to have performed very well, the frequency and influence of polls seems to have dipped slightly. That’s a pity, because what information we have tells a fascinating story: one of two parties apparently marooned on very similar shares of the vote, while increasingly inhabiting parallel universes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It’s not of course possible to tighten down with vast precision on exactly how the Westminster parties would do if there were a General Election tomorrow – British polling has &lt;a href=&quot;https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/uk-election-hung-parliament/&quot;&gt;a mediocre, though not in truth an appalling, record&lt;/a&gt; in this respect – but the broad lines of politics in 2018 have been long-established. Labour and the Conservatives are locked together, somewhere between the high 30s and low 40s in terms of vote share: sometimes one moves higher and threatens to break away, but neither seem able to gain a decisive advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In truth, it’s Labour who have had a strangely mediocre time of it. If we take a look at &lt;a href=&quot;https://britainelects.com/polling/westminster/&quot;&gt;the excellent Britain Elects website&lt;/a&gt;, Labour entered the year in the low 40s, with an advantage of a couple of percentage points: the party had, of course, enjoyed an extraordinary year, during which it had surged in the polls during the 2017 general election. When I reviewed 2017’s polling in this space a year ago, I thought that the passing of time and the rules of political gravity might help Labour break away entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	That hasn’t happened. Labour has drifted downwards, especially after a torrid spring marked by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/world/2018/3/29/17168320/labour-corbyn-anti-semitism-mural&quot;&gt;ugly anti-Semitism row&lt;/a&gt; and its hesitant reaction to the Salisbury chemical attack. A raw average of every polling companies’ most recent survey right now in fact produces a very slight Conservative lead. They stand on 39.1 per cent, as against 38.7 per cent for Labour. If we factor in the latest polling from Wales, Scotland and London, that gives us a House of Commons that looks very roughly like: 301 Conservative MPs, 272 Labour, 39 SNP and 15 Liberal Democrats. That’s not very much movement on the 2017 result: 317 Conservative, 262 Labour, 35 SNP and 12 Liberal Democrats. The most surprising thing about polling over the last year is how stable is has been, despite all the squalls and alarms that obsessive Westminster watchers fixate on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A new House of Commons wouldn’t look exactly like that. Polls very likely wouldn’t prove precisely accurate; regional trends and tactical voting would change the picture. But as a very basic guide to where we are now, what we can say is that things are finely balanced. You would in general say that Labour were in pole position to form a very weak minority government, but the Conservatives are ahead at the moment in the race for most seats. That would make for a very unstable situation, to say the least: those numbers would probably lead to another government that would struggle to deliver any sort of Brexit at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	These Labour scores are middling by historical standards, and they fall somewhere in between the performance of recent Labour oppositions. Eighteen months after the Conservative election victories of 1983 and 1987, the Tories led by 7.2 per cent and 8 per cent respectively before going on to win the next election; in 1980 and 1993, Labour were racking up huge leads of 11 per cent and 16.2 per cent. That first lead evaporated, while the second of course led to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ipsos.com/ipsos-mori/en-uk/10-myths-about-1997-election&quot;&gt;the Labour landslide of 1997&lt;/a&gt;. It’s not clear from these numbers whether the present neck-and-neck horserace means either victory or defeat next time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One other key point is how much the Liberal Democrats have struggled. Normally, the two main parties’ relative unpopularity would see them power ahead. The last time the two party leaders were this distrusted at the same time, in the early 1970s and the mid-1980s, saw Jeremy Thorpe’s Liberals and then the SDP-Liberal Alliance surge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But now, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politicshome.com/news/uk/political-parties/liberal-democrats/vince-cable/news/99690/excl-lib-dem-bosses-called&quot;&gt;out of money&lt;/a&gt;, struggling for airtime and led by the strangely lacklustre Vince Cable, they seem to be going nowhere. Their polling average stands at 8.6 per cent, up only a point from the 7.6 per cent they gained in 2017. It seems like they will have to wait for some more general realignment to feel renewed wind in their sails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It’s clear that the parties are favoured to govern two very different Britains. If we turn to leadership, identity, immigration, security or Brexit, then the Conservatives have the upper hand; if the agenda moves onto the increasingly parlous state of the threadbare public services, as it did during the 2017 General Election, then Labour gains sudden traction. &lt;a href=&quot;http://britainthinks.com/news/breaking-the-deadlock-what-the-main-parties-could-do-to-move-ahead-in-the-polls-britainthinks-research&quot;&gt;One recent report from the pollsters Britain Thinks&lt;/a&gt;, appropriately titled &lt;em&gt;Breaking the Deadlock&lt;/em&gt;, summed things up very well. The single biggest thing the Conservatives could do to break out of their trenches would be to increase spending on the National Health Service – and, of course, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politico.eu/article/britain-nationalist-dark-web-populism-tommy-robinson/&quot;&gt;convince voters that they had done so&lt;/a&gt;; the most important thing Labour could do was to dump a leader perceived as weak and out-of-touch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Both parties look superficially as if they command a whole tranche of the British electorate: but their grip on that share is much more uncertain that it looks. The first to abandon their fixed positions and launch a war of manoeuvre, accept their weaknesses, and talk straightforwardly about the choices ahead as they see them, could capture all that ground that now looks so heavily fortified.&lt;br /&gt;
	Can either make the leap? For now, it looks doubtful. But after a tumultuous 2017 and 2018, one thing’s for sure: you can rule nothing out for certain.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;
	In Boots Riley’s absurdist dark comedy &lt;em&gt;Sorry to Bother You&lt;/em&gt; we see a world deteriorating. Things are not simply bad, they are getting worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The film has been called “this year’s &lt;em&gt;Get Out&lt;/em&gt;”, with the two described as “social thrillers” – a term coined by &lt;em&gt;Get Out&lt;/em&gt; director &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jul/20/sorry-to-bother-you-boots-riley&quot;&gt;Jordan Peele&lt;/a&gt;. Both films are grotesque caricatures that derive humour and horror from social issues that are all too real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But while &lt;em&gt;Get Out&lt;/em&gt; is a horror story about racism, the caustic humour in &lt;em&gt;Sorry to Bother You&lt;/em&gt; targets many of the intersecting kinds of oppression that people face. Chris Washington (Daniel Kaluuya) has to deal with his girlfriend’s racist family, whereas Cassius “Cash” Green (Lakeith Stanfield) is embattled by an entire system, of which racism is one aspect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Making capitalism the villain feels quite on the nose in 2018. The film begins with a broke Cassius attempting to trick and then beg his way into a commission based telemarketing job. The depiction of the desperate desire for a job you know you’ll hate invites comparison with the screw-your-arsehole-boss cult-classic &lt;em&gt;Office Space. &lt;/em&gt;Made in 1999 when that system appeared to be in better health, the villain has different characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Here, the enemy is soul-sapping ennui of corporate life; having to fill in a different set of boring forms, prison-like office booths, occasional weekend shifts. Such complaints give Peter Gibbons (Ron Livingston), an IT worker who writes code to avert the millennium bug, an eternal “case of the Mondays”. He tries to hide from his boss and undertakes hypnotherapy, before hatching a hare-brained scheme to hack the company account and make enough money never to have to work again. But if he really has to, more fulfilling employment will surely come along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Cassius should be so lucky. Fast forward two decades and we’re in post-crash capitalism with its looming foreclosures and financial desperation. To survive in telemarketing he must not only “Stick To The Script” but mitigate his blackness by “Code Switching” – Cassius is encouraged by his old-timer Langston (Danny Glover) to adopt a “white voice” to make more sales. This does the trick and, as his career improves, he must choose between either moral bankruptcy or financial hardship. He achieves promotion to become an elite “Power Caller”, selling diabolical products to heinous corporate clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Evil can’t be reduced to one bad guy or corporation: each character must navigate a system that invades every aspect of their lives. As his co-workers organise to improve their conditions, he breaks a picket in order to continue his high paid job and pay off his landlord and uncle. Cassius’ partner Detroit (Tessa Thompson) finds his strike-breaking reprehensible. A member of radical group “The Left-Eye”, even she makes a living selling art to rich people. By confronting the viewer with the stark choices faced living under capitalism, the film stays relatable even as the world Cassius inhabits becomes a grotesque, hallucinogenic techno-dystopia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In &lt;em&gt;Office Space&lt;/em&gt; Peter Gibbons and his pals don’t need to confront reality. When they decide to steal from the company in order to get one over on their employer, it’s a farce. You know it’ll go hilariously wrong and it’s funny because nobody would ever be that bravely stupid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Resistance to the system is individualised and has no horizons beyond the workplace itself. The trouble starts when Gibbons steps into the office, and ends as soon as he gets to go fishing with his neighbour. Great fun though it is; it is ultimately just escapist misadventure – &lt;em&gt;Ferris Bueller&#039;s Day Off&lt;/em&gt; for grownups. Their day-dreaming about a life without work (playing “if I had a million dollars”) seems a less realistic prospect than the most evil plans of &lt;em&gt;Sorry to Bother You&lt;/em&gt;’s Steve Lift (Armie Hammer), CEO of WorryFree and a parody of the most maniacal Silicon Valley Burning Man boss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Cassius ultimately discovers that the only way out of the straitjacket he finds himself in is to take collective action with those with whom he has the most in common. He and his comrades aren’t satisfied with a less harsh life, though that in itself is a radical demand. They want a better world, and they want revenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While &lt;em&gt;Sorry to Bother You&lt;/em&gt; is off-the-wall and hilariously bizarre, its message is firmly grounded in the recognisable injustice of a system whose decadence is seeing it teetering on the edge of collapse. That makes it all the funnier and more cathartic.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--

    <title>It’s said another referendum could be disastrous for Labour. So will the party back May’s deal?</title>
    <link>https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/staggers/2018/12/it-s-said-another-referendum-could-be-disastrous-labour-so-will-party-back</link>

	Len McCluskey has warned that supporting a people’s vote could blow Labour’s chances in the next election.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-node-image field-type-image field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;noscript class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoints=&quot;300 768 1024&quot; data-adaptive-image-300-img=&quot;&amp;lt;img class=&amp;quot;adaptive-image&amp;quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&amp;quot;300&amp;quot; typeof=&amp;quot;foaf:Image&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2018/12/gettyimages-610502724.jpg?itok=WPpyfRCe&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&quot; data-adaptive-image-768-img=&quot;&amp;lt;img class=&amp;quot;adaptive-image&amp;quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&amp;quot;768&amp;quot; typeof=&amp;quot;foaf:Image&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2018/12/gettyimages-610502724.jpg?itok=WPpyfRCe&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&quot; data-adaptive-image-1024-img=&quot;&amp;lt;img class=&amp;quot;adaptive-image&amp;quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&amp;quot;1024&amp;quot; typeof=&amp;quot;foaf:Image&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2018/12/gettyimages-610502724.jpg?itok=WPpyfRCe&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&quot; data-adaptive-image-max-img=&quot;&amp;lt;img class=&amp;quot;adaptive-image&amp;quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&amp;quot;max&amp;quot; typeof=&amp;quot;foaf:Image&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2018/12/gettyimages-610502724.jpg?itok=WPpyfRCe&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&quot;&gt;&lt;img typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2018/12/gettyimages-610502724.jpg?itok=WPpyfRCe&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;
	What, other than the fact they are both trade unions, connects the National Farmers’ Union and Unite? The answer is that both represent workers who are on course to lose out from Brexit and that neither feel able to explicitly call for the result to be overturned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	That essential truth is a vital part of understanding the politics behind &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/staggers/2018/12/len-mccluskey-second-brexit-referendum-risks-tearing-our-society-apart&quot;&gt;Unite president Len McCluskey’s intervention for the &lt;em&gt;New Statesman&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, in which he said publicly what he has been telling Labour MPs privately: that another referendum risks blowing the next election for Labour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	He has left himself plenty of wriggle room to support a Remain vote should that contest happen – remember that Unite’s position in that referendum is not in McCluskey’s gift but of Unite’s executive committee – but made it clear that as far as he is concerned, another vote is a big risk for Labour and a potential disaster for the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One of the reasons why the referendum went the way it did is that people working in farming and manufacturing voted in a way that it is not immediately clear aligns with their economic interests. Both the carmakers represented by McCluskey and the farmers represented by NFU president Minette Batters have much to lose by leaving the single market and the customs union. Yet the NFU had to restrict itself to a pre-referendum statement to members stating that although it thought that continuing membership of the European Union was best for British farmers, it would not actually campaign for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Most British trades unions backed a Remain vote, but with a handful of exceptions they found a hostile response on their shop floors, and none report any real shift in priorities among their members. (Which is what we’d expect from the polls, where the shift to Remain is based on fading enthusiasm among Brexit voters and the entry of new Remain voters into the electorate thanks to demographic change.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Anyone who thinks that McCluskey’s intervention is because of some deference on his part to Jeremy Corbyn needs to find a way to reconcile that analysis with the Labour Party’s row over Heathrow, which Corbyn thinks is an environmental calamity and John McDonnell has made it his personal mission to oppose airport expansion as one of the MPs whose constituency is directly under the flightpath. Unite has shown remarkably little compunction in voting to undercut the leader’s office when their interests conflict. The difficult truth for anyone who would prefer to see Brexit overturned is that McCluskey’s balancing act on Brexit has as much to do with his day job as head of a trades union as it does with the game of Labour power politics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It further underlines the fraught parliamentary path to a second referendum as well as the difficulties of winning the rematch. We know that Nicky Morgan, Nick Boles and Jonathan Djanogly won’t vote for it. We know that a sizable number of Labour MPs – it’s worth noting that Gloria De Piero, no one’s idea of a Bennite or a Brexiteer for that matter, approvingly shared the piece on Twitter – won’t vote for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	So why do supporters of a second referendum think they have a shot? They take comfort from the fact that Amber Rudd has become the first cabinet minister to basically echo what McCluskey is saying – &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/itvpeston/status/1075490705873596417&quot;&gt;telling Robert Peston&lt;/a&gt; that while another referendum isn’t her preferred route, she might reluctantly back one if needed, but that MPs ought to find a way forward to negotiate a Brexit deal – and think that, when push comes to shove, Labour opponents of another referendum will choose it over no deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But will they? It feels equally likely, given that we know that Corbyn is not going to expend a single penny of political capital arguing for another referendum, that Labour MPs who fear no deal but don’t want to risk another referendum will use his remarks as cloud cover to explain why they are, reluctantly, voting for the withdrawal agreement the second time around. (Assuming that is, that the Labour leadership decides that it is better off casting itself as the victim of Labour MPs voting for the agreement rather than the agent of a compromise in the national interest. Both schools of thought are represented in the inner circles of Labour power.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Add that to the growing number of pro-Brexit Conservatives who are realising that the chances are that rejecting the withdrawal agreement only ends with a softer Brexit, and you begin to understand why Tory supporters of May’s accord are starting to perk up a bit as parliament shuts up and heads off for the Christmas holidays.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--

    <title>As a young Unite member, Len McCluskey does not represent me on Brexit</title>
    <link>https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/staggers/2018/12/young-unite-member-len-mccluskey-does-not-represent-me-brexit</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-subheadline field-type-text-long field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;
	YouGov polling shows that 57 per cent of young Unite members – such as myself – think our union should back a second referendum on the Brexit deal. &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-node-image field-type-image field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;noscript class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoints=&quot;300 768 1024&quot; data-adaptive-image-300-img=&quot;&amp;lt;img class=&amp;quot;adaptive-image&amp;quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&amp;quot;300&amp;quot; typeof=&amp;quot;foaf:Image&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2018/12/gettyimages-544294332.jpg?itok=uWQkbe87&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;Len McCluskey&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&quot; data-adaptive-image-768-img=&quot;&amp;lt;img class=&amp;quot;adaptive-image&amp;quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&amp;quot;768&amp;quot; typeof=&amp;quot;foaf:Image&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2018/12/gettyimages-544294332.jpg?itok=uWQkbe87&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;Len McCluskey&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&quot; data-adaptive-image-1024-img=&quot;&amp;lt;img class=&amp;quot;adaptive-image&amp;quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&amp;quot;1024&amp;quot; typeof=&amp;quot;foaf:Image&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2018/12/gettyimages-544294332.jpg?itok=uWQkbe87&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;Len McCluskey&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&quot; data-adaptive-image-max-img=&quot;&amp;lt;img class=&amp;quot;adaptive-image&amp;quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&amp;quot;max&amp;quot; typeof=&amp;quot;foaf:Image&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2018/12/gettyimages-544294332.jpg?itok=uWQkbe87&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;Len McCluskey&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&quot;&gt;&lt;img typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2018/12/gettyimages-544294332.jpg?itok=uWQkbe87&quot; alt=&quot;Len McCluskey&quot; /&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;
	There is one thing on which Len McCluskey and I agree: it’s clear we have a divided society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	And no longer is it the binary, simple Leave vs Remain. We now have many on the left calling for a “Corbyn/jobs-first Brexit”, with no indicator of what this really means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As a young person, I yearn for a cohesive Labour Brexit stance that benefits not only party members but all people, including Unite members like myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I’m therefore disappointed, if not surprised, by Len McCluskey and other leading political figures. Those who are meant to represent me and my interests seem to be making decisions on one criterion – the internal politics of the Labour Party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/staggers/2018/12/len-mccluskey-second-brexit-referendum-risks-tearing-our-society-apart&quot;&gt;In his recent article&lt;/a&gt;, McCluskey outlined his concerns regarding a second referendum, claiming we cannot undermine a “decision taken by a clear majority just two years ago”. Aside from the fact that this majority clearly no longer exists – with most polls showing a clear lead both for wanting a People’s Vote and staying within the European Union – what about the members he is meant to represent?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	YouGov polling shows that 57 per cent of young Unite members such as myself think our union should back a People’s Vote. Four out of five of us would vote to stay within the European Union if such a vote were held. I therefore ask the leader of my union – why should our voices be ignored?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While neither the European Union nor a People’s Vote should be absolved from criticism – I worry about whether Unite’s leadership truly understand the reasons why people voted Leave. When McCluskey refers to Mansfield – a town just 15 minutes away from my home – he argues that the core constituency there was to vote against the “the neo-liberal elite”. I’m not convinced Mr McCluskey has spent much time in Mansfield, as it&#039;s clear from speaking to anyone there that this is not the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Under the Conservatives, the cuts to policing and social security have decimated much of Mansfield’s community. The average income is way below the national average, alongside a high unemployment rate and few opportunities for young people in the area. It is issues like this that caused 71 per cent of people in Mansfield to vote Leave, not a faceless political faction. But, in an area neglected under the Tories, the last thing young people need is the uncertainty and risk that the current Brexit will bring to their jobs and livelihoods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	McCluskey and I would also agree on the answer to what must done about tackling austerity. We need a Labour government to rectify the wrongs of the past decade – to be radical and rebuild an economy to work for the many, not the few.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The reality is that this cannot come about with a weak and incohesive stance on Brexit. As shown at the recent Labour Party conference and in recent polling, both Labour members (87 per cent) and young Unite members (57 per cent) are seeking a People’s Vote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This isn’t just about winning: without a People’s Vote, a future Labour government has no real opportunity to implement progressive, socialist legislative change, as we will be working to clean up the current Brexit mess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It’s clear that decisions regarding Brexit go past party lines. Unite jobs are at risk, a fact that it is time people recognised. As one of Britain’s largest unions, it is essential that at this time of national crisis, we stand in favour of workers, not internal party politics. Recent reports show we will be worse off with Brexit, a result that will disproportionately affect the young and the poor. We must stand tall against the hard Brexiters and say that no one voted for this deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While we must address concerns of Leave voters, we cannot do so by playing into the hands of right. The likes of Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage want to convince us that this is what people want, and we cannot be fooled. Unite workers did not vote to lose their jobs. Labour members did not vote to be worse off. British people did not vote to be poorer, internationally isolated and to be told what they believe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	That’s why I say again. As a young woman and a Unite member, I ask Len McCluskey: support the voices of your members who are asking for a chance to be heard. Recognise that a People’s Vote is what the majority wants, and is in the interest of your members – including myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This isn’t about putting country before party – I strongly believe the only way we can get a radical Labour government is by backing a People’s Vote. Polling shows this consistently. Even if I were to be proven wrong on this count – a Corbyn-led government in this entirety would be doomed to the same failure as Theresa May’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;Elsie Greenwood is a young Unite member and a supporter of For our Future’s Sake&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;
	For the first time since 2005, the Doctor is not at home to Christmas visitors, ending a 13-year streak of Christmas Day specials, and her absence has left a conspicuous hole in the BBC One schedule for 25 December. The previously all-conquering BBC One Christmas line-up is looking tired, and the unanticipated dematerialisation of &lt;em&gt;Doctor Who&lt;/em&gt; – the second most watched UK drama this year, and a programme plenty of people are loudly excited about – curiously calls attention to, rather than ameliorating, that fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Amongst this year’s returners are &lt;em&gt;Call the Midwife&lt;/em&gt;, which has occupied prime real estate on BBC One’s Christmas day since 2012 (that’s seven in a row, with next year’s already tentatively booked); and &lt;em&gt;Mrs Brown’s Boys&lt;/em&gt; (six in a row, since 2013). Either or both may overtake &lt;em&gt;Doctor Who&lt;/em&gt; in time. But neither are likely to catch their schedule mate &lt;em&gt;EastEnders&lt;/em&gt;, which has managed at least one Christmas Day episode, and often two, every year since 1991; it also chalked up two prior Christmas Day appearances in 1986 and 1987.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	That’s 27 in a row; 29 in total. Even counting double episodes as one, that’s a lot. Can anyone beat that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The size of that run, over a quarter of a century, means that you can immediately discount the possibility of anything made for Channel 5 or Sky from threatening it, leaving ITV and other BBC series as the only serious possibilities, with Channel 4 an outside bet. So can anything do it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Sometimes your instincts with regards to these things are just plain wrong. The &lt;em&gt;BBC A Ghost Story For Christmas&lt;/em&gt; strand, which ran uninterrupted from 1971 to 1978, and which has been revived several times since, including this year, has only been on Christmas Day itself three times: 1975’s &lt;em&gt;Lost Hearts&lt;/em&gt;, 1978’s &lt;em&gt;The Ice House&lt;/em&gt; and 2013’s&lt;em&gt; The Tractate Middoth&lt;/em&gt;. More usually it’s been shown in the build up to Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;Only Fools and Horses&lt;/em&gt; is a series indelibly associated with Christmas television in the public mind, but that can only boast 14 Christmas Day episodes between 1983 and 2003, with its longest streak being nine in a row. Impressive, but nowhere close to the record. Of even greater renown in an earlier era where the&lt;em&gt; Morecambe and Wise&lt;/em&gt; Christmas Shows. But Eric and Ernie could only chalk up 12 in a row, from 1969 to 1980, the last three on ITV following their defection from BBC One to the commercial channel. Even then 1974, which was an interview with the pair backed by clips, put together because Morecambe’s recent heart attack made recording new material impossible, shouldn’t really count. (It goes without saying, of course, that repeats of the hardy perennials of Christmas television, such as the annually reshown &lt;em&gt;Porridge&lt;/em&gt; Christmas episodes, can’t possibly count more than once.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Perhaps there’s something in television’s pre-history to rival&lt;em&gt; EastEnders&lt;/em&gt;’ dominance? ITV’s first ever Christmas schedule, in 1955, saw the evening’s entertainment dominated by &lt;em&gt;Saturday Night at the London Palladium&lt;/em&gt;, a series that would, in various and renamed forms, bounce in and out of television schedules until 2016. Oddly, its most recent host was Bradley Walsh, who would be in this year’s Christmas Day &lt;em&gt;Doctor Who&lt;/em&gt;, if there was one; but, it hasn’t notched up enough Christmas episodes to worry us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In a similar vein, all but forgotten now is BBC &lt;em&gt;Christmas Night With The Stars&lt;/em&gt;, the centrepiece of the channel’s Christmas schedule most years from 1958 to 1972. A sort of variety slash sketch show, featuring mini episodes of popular series, such as &lt;em&gt;Dixon of Dock Green&lt;/em&gt; or&lt;em&gt; Steptoe and Son&lt;/em&gt;, its 12 episodes in 15 years don’t get us close to either record we’re trying to beat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To look through these earlier Christmas Day schedules is often to see current approaches to linear TV Christmas programming in embryonic form. 1957 saw the first “proper” Christmas special of an ITV series, with &lt;em&gt;The Christmas Present&lt;/em&gt;, a special festive episode of the Marius Goring-starring adventure series,&lt;em&gt; The Scarlet Pimpernel&lt;/em&gt;. Positioned in the early evening, as a programme enjoyed by both children and adults, it was doing the same job &lt;em&gt;Doctor Who &lt;/em&gt;was on BBC One 12 months ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Similarly, in 1958 ITV premiered &lt;em&gt;The Maltese Falcon&lt;/em&gt;, a hugely popular film which was then only 15 years old, pointing the way to the channel’s dominance of Christmas viewing in later decades, when it used its greater spending power to purchase blockbusters: the 1984 Christmas Day premiere of &lt;em&gt;Raiders of the Lost Ark&lt;/em&gt;, for example, or its three Eighties Christmas week premieres of what were then all of the &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; films, or its recent reliance on &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	ITV must have some homegrown programming to rival &lt;em&gt;EastEnders &lt;/em&gt;though? Oh, of course: &lt;em&gt;Coronation Street&lt;/em&gt;. The senior soap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Corrie’s first Christmas Day episode was way back In 1961, slightly more than a year after its own debut. It was a curious affair, with an Equity strike limiting the number of performers available to the production. A creative solution was found, with the episode concentrating on the preparation of Christmas dinners: the male characters were all off screen attending a football match as the street’s women did all the work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;Coronation Street&lt;/em&gt;’s Christmas Day episodes, which vary from high drama to variety and back again, would fill a book. Yet, while it is currently a Christmas Day fixture, it has been absent from the day itself on several occasions since 1961. In the whole of the seventies the soap only managed one Christmas episode, in 1972; and its current streak started in 1994,&lt;em&gt; after EastEnders&lt;/em&gt;’. Nevertheless, its 37 (total) and 24 (continuous) make it ITV’s nearest equivalent to&lt;em&gt; EastEnders&lt;/em&gt; in this, as in so many other ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	That must be ITV’s best option, and it’s just fallen short. Is it worth looking at Channel 4? Probably not. Its best option is its &lt;em&gt;Alternative Christmas Message&lt;/em&gt;, which has run non-stop since 1993: a bit better than Corrie, a bit worse than &lt;em&gt;EastEnders&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But hang on, if the Alternative Christmas Message counts, then surely that to which it’s an alternative does too? There’s one thing that’s been on every Christmas Day for as long as anyone can remember. &lt;em&gt;The Queen’s Christmas Message&lt;/em&gt; (usually simply referred to in listings as simply “Her Majesty The Queen”) has been on both BBC and ITV simultaneously since 1957, with the curious exception of 1969. Before that, it was on the radio – with both BBC TV (from 1952) and ITV (from 1955) choosing, in the years immediately before the speech transitioned to the visual medium, to broadcast the BBC radio signal as a special “sound-only television programme”, to quote a 1956 issue of&lt;em&gt; TV Times&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If that’s a television series, and I don’t really think you can argue that it isn’t, then that means that, even with that blip at the end of the sixties, HMQ has a clear uninterrupted run of 49 years of Christmas specials, with her total number of Christmas Day specials coming in at 66.&lt;em&gt; EastEnders&lt;/em&gt; has no answer to that, and it beats everything I’ve dismissed, ignored or not included too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When it comes to records of longevity, Elizabeth II is the only surefire way to beat the Queen Vic.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--

    <title>The immigration white paper is a combination of bad economics and toxic politics</title>

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;
	There is a lot that is obviously wrong with the government’s proposals for immigration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The aspect that has attracted the most derision is the £30,000 salary floor, designed supposedly to weed out “unskilled” migrants. But of course, many jobs that are visibly high skilled do not meet this threshold or do so only in some parts of country. A chef cooking Michelin Bib quality food would be classed as “unskilled” if they were cooking award-winning food in rural Cornwall but “skilled” if they were cooking meals of the same quality in London. A chef cannot become unskilled purely by leaving a major city. A newly qualified doctor cannot become “skilled” solely by dint of having done an extra shift of overtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If implemented, the minimum salary requirement would make everyone in the United Kingdom poorer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The big economic problem, of course, is that the divide between “skilled” and “unskilled” migration is entirely arbitrary and any immigration system that attempts to divide people who want to come to a country in this manner is doomed either to ridicule or to failure, as its architects are forced to poke increasingly ridiculous holes in it. Take Australia’s “skilled occupations list”, which in 2002 included hairdressers but excluded glaziers. Now in 2018 it includes glaziers but excludes hairdressers. Has installing a window become more skilled a job in the past 16 years? Has hairdressing got easier? The answer to both these questions is the same: no. What has changed is that the needs of the economy have shifted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The state is good at a number of things but it tends to be exceptionally poor at working out what types of immigration a country “needs”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But there are also problems with how these proposals address not just what the country needs, but what British voters want. Voters consistently tell pollsters, academics, television cameras and essentially anyone who will listen that what they want from immigrants is people who come to the United Kingdom to learn English, to integrate into society, to work and to put down roots, or to have come here to study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;All &lt;/em&gt;of these types of immigration are discouraged by the government’s plans. Increasing the number of time-limited 12-month visas of course means that most immigrants to Britain will be transitory, and making it harder for people to bring loved ones means that they will not put down roots or bother to integrate into society. Those contemplating studying in the United Kingdom will be discouraged by the prospect of being turfed out as soon as a random celebrity has handed them their degree certificate, especially when they could instead go to a European or American university and be more likely to be able to stay and find a job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	So the government’s white paper is a remarkable document, in that it cannot, as written, meet the economic needs of the country or the electoral demands of British voters.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--

	Fiona Onasanya, the Labour MP for Peterborough, has been found guilty of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice. The former lawyer, who was first elected in 2017, was found to have misled police in order to avoid speeding charges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Labour Party has suspended her and called for her resignation, but the opposition has no formal power to remove a sitting MP, so it is not clear that the verdict will trigger a by-election in Onasanya’s Peterborough seat, a tightly-fought marginal that Onasanya won by only 638 votes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An MP is automatically kicked out of the Commons only if they are sentenced to more than 12 months in prison. Onasanya’s crime carries a minimum tariff of three months and a maximum of 38. Chris Huhne, who was convicted for a similar offence, submitted a guilty plea and was sentenced to eight months but voluntarily resigned his seat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If Onasanya chooses to resign or receives a jail term of more than a year, it would open up a finely balanced contest in a marginal seat that voted heavily to leave the European Union in the immediate run-up to Brexit.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--

    <title>Like many Brits, Tony Blair completely misunderstands freedom of movement</title>

	Last week, former British prime minister Tony Blair, who is campaigning for a second referendum on Brexit, said something that made no sense. It wasn’t about another vote (although repeating that it is “probably going to happen” when the British government is running out of time to prepare for no deal, let alone organising a new vote, isn’t exactly the political declaration of the year). It was about the free movement of people within the European Union, and how the UK, by staying in the union, could help reform it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Tony Blair, who for ten years, one month and 25 days was the leader of an EU member state, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.euronews.com/2018/12/17/tony-blair-on-a-2nd-brexit-referendum-the-probability-is-it-s-going-to-happen&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;: “Freedom of movement is also an issue. It’s an issue in the rest of Europe as well. It’s why, for example, some countries in Europe say ‘if you come, migrate from another country in Europe and you haven’t found a job within a couple of months and the means to support yourself, you’re put back out again.’” Freedom of movement, Blair added, “has got to operate in a way that is fair and just, doesn’t undercut wages, and doesn’t cause problems for individual countries”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	That a former British leader, a Remainer and pro-Europe politician so fundamentally misrepresents the EU principle of free movement speaks volumes about the UK’s concept of migration as a whole. Freedom of movement allows EU nationals to live and work in another EU country. Under freedom of movement, jobseekers can move to another EU country to look for work, and although your host country can ask you to leave, &lt;a href=&quot;https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/residence/residence-rights/jobseekers/index_en.htm&quot;&gt;it can only do so after six months&lt;/a&gt; (not “a couple of months”), and can only deport you if it can prove you pose a serious threat. You won’t “be put back out” under free movement for moving to another country and trying to find work there – that is quite essentially what freedom of movement is &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt;. Blair is wrong in his very definition of what the EU thinks as borders: migrants from within the EU aren’t seen as a problem, it’s the ones from outside that are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Brexit has long put the “us vs them” line between the UK and the EU, from Nigel Farage’s “Breaking point” posters to Theresa May’s broken record speeches promising to “take back control of our borders, laws and money”, in this specific order. You would think the law would come first – Brexit was supposed to be about sovereignty, after all – or that at least money would prevail, because the City and UK businesses must be preserved. But no: it’s always borders first. Borders with the EU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	No matter that EU migration greatly benefits the country. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-45565124&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; from the Migration Advisory Committee found that EU citizens living in the UK pay in more tax than they take out in benefits; that migration can lead to new jobs instead of competition for existing ones; and that there is no evidence that European migrants are draining public services. As the British government plans to impose a £30,000 threshold on new EU migrants, it’s clear that post-Brexit, no EU nationals in their right mind will choose to move to the UK where they’ll be stigmatised as “migrants” when they can work in 27 countries where they&#039;ll be considered “workers” like anyone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Freedom of movement expert Tony Blair is just the latest in a long series of British politicians to misunderstand free movement or demonise it altogether – but because he’s a Remainer, it somehow hurts double. What’s the point of campaigning for the UK to remain in the EU if you too disagree with one of its founding principles? If the long and painful process of the Brexit negotiations showed one thing, it was the incredible ingenuity demonstrated by the British side to cherry-pick between the EU’s other freedoms (of capitals, goods, and services) while ditching free movement of people, and the infinite patience of the EU side, which found thousands of ways to politely explain that it wasn’t going to happen. Remainers are supposed to know better – to, at the very least, understand what they wish to remain into. As Stephen Bush &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/staggers/2018/12/if-second-referendum-campaigners-can-t-stand-free-movement-they-should&quot;&gt;rightly wrote&lt;/a&gt;: if second referendum campaigners can’t stand up for free movement, they should give up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Britons see borders where their European neighbours see lines on the map. European holidaymakers can pack their luggage in France in the morning, change a flat tyre in Germany at 11am, picnic on a Swiss motorway rest area at lunch, and set their tent on an Italian camping ground in time for tea (well, Spritz), without having to queue miserably at airports or at Dover ferries once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Tony Blair, Theresa May, and many other Brits misunderstand free movement because they’ve never properly lived it. Britain’s only regulated border is the sea – and the UK’s only land border in the British Isles was a danger zone for decades&lt;b&gt;. &lt;/b&gt;Within the borderless Schengen area, frontiers mean as little as driving through villages. In my home region in France, which is close to both Luxembourg and Germany, locals live in the first country, work in the second and shop in the third. They know that petrol and tobacco are cheaper in Luxembourg, but that Germany offers cosmetics for the best price. Luxembourg is the closest airport, Saarbrücken the closest big city. Different languages blur into dialects, people accommodate; the borders were there before us but we cross them without minding. Why would we? We speak French but we’ll buy pretzels, and they’ll order baguette with a German accent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Brits, on their island, have borders they don’t share. How lonely must they feel.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--

    <title>Stupidgate and six other things we learned from this week’s Prime Minister’s Questions</title>

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt; &lt;h3 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	1. Jeremy Corbyn’s Commons performances can still be a liability for Labour&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Even Jeremy Corbyn’s closest allies admit that he is neither entirely comfortable nor at his best in the Commons chamber, where his performances are often antsy and his demeanour irritable. On a day where a strong line of questioning from the Labour leader on Brexit delivered a clear win over Theresa May, that inconvenient truth saw him become the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	Having been accused by Corbyn of a “criminal waste of money” over no-deal planning, the Prime Minister engaged her benches in a pantomime call-and-response routine. “I know it’s the Christmas season and the pantomime season,” she said. “He’s going to put a confidence vote – oh yes he is, oh no she isn’t...I’ve got some advice. Look behind you! They are not impressed and neither is the country.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	As the cameras panned to the leader of the opposition, he was caught muttering something that looked an awful lot like “stupid woman”. His spokesman insists he said “stupid people”, and that denial – and refusal to apologise – will ensure this one runs and runs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	It was met by opprobrium and an outbreak of unity on the Tory benches, who demanded an apology from Corbyn in several points of order after PMQs had finished. It’s a salutary reminder that no matter how parlous things are for the government - and how well Labour is exploiting that weakness - Corbyn’s weakness as a Commons performer can very quickly become the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	In this case, it’s engendered near-universal sympathy for a Prime Minister loathed by many on her own benches – some small relief as she attempts to convince wavering MPs that backing her withdrawal agreement is essentially a partisan issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	2. The Tories still hate John Bercow – but he won’t go anytime soon&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The ruckus over Corbyn’s alleged aside was followed by an even testier exchange between John Bercow – who refused to intervene or demand an apology – and Andrea Leadsom, in which the Commons leader asked why the Speaker had not apologised when he had called her a “stupid woman” in May.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	Her intervention from the government frontbench delighted many of her colleagues, few of whom took heed of the Speaker’s calls for order as he came in for hectic questioning after the session.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	Though an indignant Bercow played down her remarks – stressing the exchange had happened months ago and questioning why Leadsom had not raised the issue since – the exchange, and how Tory MPs reacted to it, underlines the depth and scale of animosity between the Speaker and the governing party. Even Anna Soubry, no friend of the prime minister, questioned why Bercow had not taken action against the leader of the opposition and contended that he would have, had Corbyn’s alleged remark come from a Conservative MP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	A friendly intervention from Labour’s Margaret Beckett followed. Her accusation that Tory MPs had “orchestrated [a] riot” and were attempting to shout Bercow down reflects the seemingly immovable force that will keep the Speaker in the chair, no matter how angry his former party gets: the almost unconditional trust and support of Labour MPs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	3. Most Brexiteers are giving Theresa May a reprieve…&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	Even before Jeremy Corbyn united her party around her, the Prime Minister was given a noticeably smooth ride by those who sought to oust her as Conservative leader last week. Andrew Bridgen, the backbench Brexiteer for whom no grievance is too petty, chose to ask May about the South African government rather than the EU. Coming as it did after a marked de-escalation of rhetoric from the leadership of the European Research Group, it is hard to escape the conclusion that most Tory Leavers have chosen to give the Prime Minister a reprieve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	4. ...but some are still carrying on the guerrilla war&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	But does that hold true for all of them? The most hostile Tory question of the session came from Philip Davies, the fundamentalist MP for Shipley, who asked whether May had taken legal advice on whether the UK would still be liable to pay its £39bn divorce bill to the EU in the event of no deal. Even if it ends up being much smaller than the 100-plus MPs who stated their opposition to the Withdrawal Agreement before the meaningful vote was pulled, there is still a sizeable minority of Tory MPs who won’t be convinced to resile from their opposition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	5. The DUP is not for turning&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	In a minority parliament, the 20 or so MPs like Davies matter enormously – especially given that the DUP, for all the crumbs of comfort some observers have seized upon in recent days, still want something that the Prime Minister doesn’t appear to be asking for and can’t deliver anyway: changes to the Withdrawal Agreement itself. The party’s Westminster leader, Nigel Dodds, asked the prime minister whether she could guarantee that she would get the changes – not reassurances – his 10 MPs want on the Irish backstop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	She could not offer them, and that fact is incredibly unlikely to have changed by January. Regardless of how emollient the DUP has sounded this week, it has not budged. As long as they are opposed, winning a majority – and the votes of Tory Brexiteers – will prove incredibly difficult for the Prime Minister. And it’s still clear that she is staking her future, and that of the UK, on being able to do the impossible and pull this off – she told Justine Greening that she was seeking “further discussion” on the backstop. We know that those discussions have already concluded with an unsatisfactory answer as far as what May wanted to win back her side of the Commons goes. Even allowing for the more fraternal mood, it’s still how to see how it ends well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	6. On Brexit, attacking Corbyn as a man without a plan lets Labour off the hook&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	Having accused Labour of wanting to block Brexit last week, May focused her attacks today on its lack of a plan to deliver it. She accused Corbyn of refusing to say what sort of exit he was for, and described the opposition’s position as “meaningless”. But for the Labour leadership, that fungible stance is precisely the point –  any move in either a more Brexity or Remainy direction threatens to destabilise their delicate electoral coalition. Though the Prime Mminister does have a clear lead over Corbyn as far as polling on leadership goes, it felt less effective as an attack line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	7. A Labour split is still on the cards&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	Will the PLP survive 2019 intact? Labour backbencher John Mann asked a very pointed question on anti-Semitism, urging politicians to “stand up and be counted” in their opposition to discrimination against Jewish people. Though the split many expected this summer did not come to fruition, tensions remain – and once the UK’s divorce from Brussels is finalised, they could explode again.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--

    <title>Len McCluskey: a second Brexit referendum risks tearing our society apart</title>
    <link>https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/staggers/2018/12/len-mccluskey-second-brexit-referendum-risks-tearing-our-society-apart</link>

	For some Labour pro-Europeans, no Brexit and no Corbyn government is a win-win.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-node-image field-type-image field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;noscript class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoints=&quot;300 768 1024&quot; data-adaptive-image-300-img=&quot;&amp;lt;img class=&amp;quot;adaptive-image&amp;quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&amp;quot;300&amp;quot; typeof=&amp;quot;foaf:Image&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2018/12/gettyimages-1043552528.jpg?itok=NT4oJ4CC&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;Len McCluskey delivers a speech. &amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&quot; data-adaptive-image-768-img=&quot;&amp;lt;img class=&amp;quot;adaptive-image&amp;quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&amp;quot;768&amp;quot; typeof=&amp;quot;foaf:Image&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2018/12/gettyimages-1043552528.jpg?itok=NT4oJ4CC&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;Len McCluskey delivers a speech. &amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&quot; data-adaptive-image-1024-img=&quot;&amp;lt;img class=&amp;quot;adaptive-image&amp;quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&amp;quot;1024&amp;quot; typeof=&amp;quot;foaf:Image&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2018/12/gettyimages-1043552528.jpg?itok=NT4oJ4CC&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;Len McCluskey delivers a speech. &amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&quot; data-adaptive-image-max-img=&quot;&amp;lt;img class=&amp;quot;adaptive-image&amp;quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&amp;quot;max&amp;quot; typeof=&amp;quot;foaf:Image&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2018/12/gettyimages-1043552528.jpg?itok=NT4oJ4CC&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;Len McCluskey delivers a speech. &amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&quot;&gt;&lt;img typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2018/12/gettyimages-1043552528.jpg?itok=NT4oJ4CC&quot; alt=&quot;Len McCluskey delivers a speech. &quot; /&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;
	A second referendum on Britain’s membership of the European Union is now clearly a possibility, as the Tory shambles risks pushing Britain towards the brink of a disastrous no-deal exit from the European Union – something few of those who voted to leave in 2016 can really have desired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But it cannot be the first choice or the preferred option for Labour Party supporters.  Better by far that parliament can agree a deal, acceptable to the European Union, which can command a broad base of support both amongst the 52 per cent who voted Leave and those in the 48 per cent who accept that democratic verdict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Labour has outlined the broad elements of such a deal – a permanent customs union, guarantees on workers’ rights and environmental protections, close alignment with the single market and a lasting solution to the Irish border question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I can see nothing in those proposals that would cause a difficulty for EU negotiators, and I believe most MPs could be won to support them as, at the very least, a pragmatic resolution to what is fast becoming a national agony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	All that is needed is a determination to push that alternative to the top of the political agenda, moving the debate on from the unappetising choices of Theresa May’s moribund deal, no deal at all, or a campaign to reverse the 2016 decision to leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I acknowledge that it is not easy for the party leadership to embrace this option, which I believe to be probably the only and certainly the best way forward. The problem in a nutshell is that the majority of the party membership remains opposed to Brexit, while the majority of working-class communities voted strongly in favour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Of course, the reality is more nuanced.   There are those on the left of the party holding to the values of Tony Benn, who opposed the European Union on democratic, not nationalistic, grounds.  On the other hand many workers, including Unite members whose jobs depend on single market access, oppose Brexit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To build the progressive future the country urgently needs, Labour must retain both constituencies of support. Bluntly, there is no route to a parliamentary majority without London, nor without the Midlands and the North, and of course Scotland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There could be nothing better designed to blow that alliance apart than a second referendum, as things stand. We are told it would be implausible to have a referendum without an option to support the status quo of EU membership, since that view is held by much of the country.  Equally, it is democratically implausible to try to set aside a decision taken by a clear majority just two years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This is a particular challenge for the labour movement.  In 2016 we were uncertain as to working-class opinion on the issue of the EU.  We have no such excuse now.  And the idea that we spend months visiting Mansfield and Middlesbrough telling the people there that they made a stupid mistake is a deeply unappealing one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	They voted above all against an out-of-touch elite whose neoliberal policies had taken from them much of what they once had and left them with nothing in its place.  Their world is no different today to what it was in 2016, a fact no amount of metropolitan moralising can get over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Many of those arguing for a second referendum have no interest in a Labour victory at the next general election. That is obviously so with regard to the Liberal Democrats or the Scottish National Party – but I suspect it may also be the case for some of the Labour advocates of this course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For a few of them, endangering the prospects of a Corbyn government would not only be a price worth paying for Britain staying in the EU, it would be a win-win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This is not to discount those genuine Labour supporters who desperately want another chance to stay in the EU. But, we must all be wary of siren voices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	That is why the premature demand for Labour to table a “no confidence” motion in the government is so self-serving.  Theresa May’s team do not deserve anyone’s confidence for sure, but there was no sign that such a motion would go through the House.  It was merely a box that some Remainers, deliberately misreading Labour’s conference decision, wished to tick on their way to a further referendum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The vast majority of the movement does not wish to sacrifice its hopes to these ambitions.  Nor does it need to.  The basis for our unity is surely Labour’s 2017 general election manifesto, committing our Party to respecting the outcome of the referendum, but framing that democratic obligation in the context of a sweeping programme of economic and social change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Of course, if the government opts for a referendum as the way out of the crisis of its own making, Labour will have to take a position.  If “remain” is an option under those circumstances, that is where Unite’s vote will most likely be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But in my view it will be no use to revert to the “remain and reform” mantra of 2016, sensible though that position was at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Nearly all the key states of the European Union are under right-wing governments, and in the last few years Brussels has shown little capacity for, and even less interest in, any sort of reform that would make the EU more progressive.  Rather, it has doubled-down on austerity and neoliberalism.  Most of Labour’s potential allies on the continent are presently polling at historic lows, victims of their own embrace of the centrist agenda. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The idea that even a Corbyn government could radically change Europe’s direction at present is fanciful.  Well-intentioned as Euro-reformers may be, their sloganising is divorced from reality and the needs of the moment, and it will not overcome the potential divisions in Labour’s support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	No, the “reform” working people need starts at home, along the lines of Labour’s manifesto.  Investment in the regions and nations beyond London and the south-east, the rebuilding of manufacturing, pushing the market out of energy, water, the railways and Royal Mail; cracking the housing crisis; restoring the NHS to health and lifting the debt burden from a generation of students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It also includes labour market reform, and I wish that the party was more forthright in publicly championing its policies of clamping down on the abuses which have caused so much dislocation and distress in working class communities.  The government has said nothing to deal with one of the main reasons people voted leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The principle is simple – ensure that everyone is paid the rate for the job; that union agreements prevail, and an end is put to the scandal of agency labour being imported by unscrupulous companies simply because it is cheaper than hiring local labour.  Migrant workers are not to blame for this, but the system that allows greedy bosses to abuse all workers. May is silent on this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The working-class movement will always fight against racism - and exploitation too.  And any trade unionist will know that our strength always needs underpinning by control of the labour supply – a deregulated free market for labour power works no better than it does in any other part of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For all these reasons, we need to handle the Brexit crisis, including the parliamentary tactics, with one thing in mind above all – the need to secure a Labour government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To have a Tory government and still be in the EU will change nothing.  And it is clear that a Tory government outside the EU will simply make many things worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It is Labour under Jeremy Corbyn that can actually start to bring the country together – or at least that majority which is anxious about the future, has seen their incomes stagnate and their prospects darken under a decade of austerity.  To get the chance it needs to offer the positive resolution to the Brexit chaos which the government cannot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	And that is not likely to be through a second referendum which risks tearing our society further apart, as the ignored majority believe their views have been scorned once again.  Now is the time for a Labour alternative on Brexit, as promised in that manifesto last year.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;
	Four weeks into the job, Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd had her first outing before the Work &amp;amp; Pensions Select Committee – defending the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/welfare/2017/10/many-many-reasons-universal-credit-not-fit-purpose&quot;&gt;disastrous new welfare system&lt;/a&gt;, Universal Credit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Her priorities in the job – making sure people have “access to the cash in good time”, are “secure in their houses” and in “payments to their landlords”, and making sure the benefit “really works for women and their families” – suggested that from the beginning Rudd was aware of its key problems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
		The five-week payment delays driving people into debt and poverty (food bank use increases in areas where Universal Credit is rolled out, including in Rudd’s constituency of Hastings, as she reported herself during the hearing).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
		Claimants falling into rent arrears and facing eviction because of delayed payments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
		Single household payments putting women in danger of being trapped in abusive households, and a two-child benefit limit punishing families.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Rudd told the committee of MPs that she would “like to keep an open mind to” slowing the rate of moving claimants onto the new system. “We will learn and see how long we need in order to ensure it’s effective,” she said, saying individuals’ experiences should be prioritised over “sticking to a prescribed timetable” – suggesting further delays in its rollout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	She admitted her “concerns about the number of appeals that get through” for Personal Independence Payments (when disability benefit assessments are overturned) which she said are “a lot” and “indicate that maybe those earlier decisions could be better made”, and also suggested some claimants shouldn’t be assessed for their eligibility as frequently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	She also revealed that “I haven’t yet been able to get cross-government support for the proposals I want to do” on ensuring &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/dec/19/mps-call-for-delay-on-universal-credit-rollout-to-protect-vulnerable-claimants&quot;&gt;more vulnerable claimants don’t lose out&lt;/a&gt; by moving from legacy benefits onto Universal Credit. Rudd wants to bring proposals forward on this aspect of the migration process in January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While she was praised by committee chair Frank Field MP for avoiding “bullshit”, and admitted “it’s not just tinkering; there have been problems”, in reality she stopped short of any meaningful overhaul of Universal Credit – and defended the most problematic aspects of the social security system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Regarding single household payments – whereby all benefits are paid into one bank account per household, therefore endangering victims of domestic abuse – Rudd said she wanted to, “ensure the main payment is made to the primary carer, and I’m going to be coming back I hope with more proposals on that in due course”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	However, she also defended the principle of single payments per household “to protect the taxpayer” and describing it as “the fair way to do it”:  “I think split payments should be available when there is a particular need, but not as the normal principle.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	She also defended the two-child benefit limit as “fair to the taxpayer”, and said jobseekers should enter insecure work to avoid being sanctioned (“the principle of sanctions is that there is a conditionality… if people are offered work, they should take it”) – even though they were not obliged to take zero-hour contract jobs under the old system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This is why Rudd’s admission of “concerns” about Universal Credit isn’t laudable simply for being candid. In fact, that makes it &lt;em&gt;worse&lt;/em&gt;. Far from the wilful blindness and ideological zeal of its creator and former DWP Secretary Iain Duncan Smith, Rudd knows full well how bad the reform is, but still defends it.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--

    <title>Is Jeremy Hunt’s leadership bid doomed to fail?</title>
    <link>https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2018/12/jeremy-hunt-s-leadership-bid-doomed-fail</link>

	This morning’s &lt;em&gt;Times &lt;/em&gt;carries as pithily brutal a summary of what a large number of Conservative MPs think of Jeremy Hunt as could be written.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	Matthew Parris believes the Foreign Secretary, often described as a frontrunner to succeed Theresa May, “may be a hologram”:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
		“Just a hunch, but it’s a feeling you do get. Certainly Mr Hunt’s opinions appear susceptible to simply being switched off. A staunch Remainer appeared to twinkle among us when David Cameron was in charge, but that “Jeremy Hunt” has been blanked out and a new super-Brexity apparition is now shimmering under the same name at Christmas receptions. Oh I don’t know, maybe I’m imagining things but there’s something eerily insubstantial in all this luminescence. Has anyone tried poking a finger into the Foreign Secretary’s chest to see whether their hand goes straight through?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	It is characteristically unsparing stuff. What’s really striking is the extent to which – give or take a few degrees of eloquence – it is the exact sentiment many a Tory MP offers when asked whether Hunt could win a leadership race, or, perhaps more pertinently, their support in one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	Having backed Remain and then publicly flirted with running as the candidate of a second referendum in 2016, Hunt has since recast himself as a born-again Brexiteer. He said last Sunday that the UK would “flourish and prosper” if it left the EU without a deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	Some colleagues think it is all unsubtle triangulation and find it unconvincing. Others ask what the Foreign Secretary actually believes: a reputation for dilettantism is taking hold. In a crowded field that will not want for candidates of consistent conviction, these perceptions will matter – and could leave him without an obvious base in the early rounds of a contest.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--

    <title>Why a no-deal Brexit won’t be stopped simply by Tory MPs threatening to quit the party</title>

	Parliament can’t just be against no-deal, it has to be proactively in favour of something else.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-node-image field-type-image field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;noscript class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoints=&quot;300 768 1024&quot; data-adaptive-image-300-img=&quot;&amp;lt;img class=&amp;quot;adaptive-image&amp;quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&amp;quot;300&amp;quot; typeof=&amp;quot;foaf:Image&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2018/12/gettyimages-546376272.jpg?itok=DefDDyvt&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&quot; data-adaptive-image-768-img=&quot;&amp;lt;img class=&amp;quot;adaptive-image&amp;quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&amp;quot;768&amp;quot; typeof=&amp;quot;foaf:Image&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2018/12/gettyimages-546376272.jpg?itok=DefDDyvt&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&quot; data-adaptive-image-1024-img=&quot;&amp;lt;img class=&amp;quot;adaptive-image&amp;quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&amp;quot;1024&amp;quot; typeof=&amp;quot;foaf:Image&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2018/12/gettyimages-546376272.jpg?itok=DefDDyvt&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&quot; data-adaptive-image-max-img=&quot;&amp;lt;img class=&amp;quot;adaptive-image&amp;quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&amp;quot;max&amp;quot; typeof=&amp;quot;foaf:Image&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2018/12/gettyimages-546376272.jpg?itok=DefDDyvt&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&quot;&gt;&lt;img typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2018/12/gettyimages-546376272.jpg?itok=DefDDyvt&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;
	The cabinet has unanimously agreed to increase its contingency planning for a no-deal exit. On the European Union’s side, the Commission has &lt;a href=&quot;https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52018DC0880&quot;&gt;announced its plans&lt;/a&gt; to manage the worst of no deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	However, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/staggers/2018/12/what-will-happen-if-there-no-deal-brexit&quot;&gt;as I explain in greater detail here&lt;/a&gt;, that’s the worst of no deal from the EU27’s perspective: so financial services won’t lose their rights of passporting overnight, in order to avoid a financial crisis that could spread to the rest of Europe, and planes will still be able to fly, avoiding a gaggle of British tourists clogging up airports throughout the continent and irate European holidaymakers venting their anger on their own politics for the month they spent living out of a suitcase in Heathrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But the painful consequences from a British perspective – queues at customs, shortages of food and other essential items – won’t be remedied by the measures taken by the European Commission. Yesterday, Nick Boles became the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/NickBoles/status/1075069709840801793&quot;&gt;first Conservative MP to say publicly what many of his colleagues have said privately&lt;/a&gt;: that in the event that no deal goes from being a contingency to the government’s main aim, he would resign the whip and vote in “any way necessary” to prevent a no-deal Brexit. Joining him already are Sarah Wollaston and Anna Soubry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	May’s hope will be that statements such as these will spook enough Leave ultras into realising that if they vote down May’s withdrawal agreement then the chances are that Brexit will get softer or not happen at all. That’s the argument being advanced by a growing number of pro-Brexit commentators outside Westminster and Tory whips hope that it will sink in over Christmas. But hard Brexiteers might well conclude that their prospects for getting what they want by default look pretty high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The problem is that even in that public trio of Tory opponents of a no-deal exit you have two very different opinions about the way out: Wollaston and Soubry are supporters of a second referendum, while Boles is a vocal opponent of one. He made sure to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/NickBoles/status/1075101425280131072&quot;&gt;reiterate that in a follow-up tweet&lt;/a&gt;, adding that he was “as opposed” to a second referendum as to a non-negotiated exit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	That’s the problem: it’s not enough for parliament to be opposed to no deal. Parliament has to be proactively in favour of something to prevent no deal. As it stands, parliament is opposed to another election (which may not settle things in any case), to another referendum (ditto), to revoking Article 50 and to the withdrawal agreement. That’s a majority for no deal by other means.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--

	&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-3e257f87-7fff-e6cd-c6b7-58a2154af07a&quot;&gt;“Conservatives,” &lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=QfX97Gj9x2sC&amp;amp;pg=PA39&amp;amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;wrote the historian&lt;/a&gt; Robert Eccleshall, “are by temperament cautious and prudent”. Suspicious of grand schemes and utopias, they venerate “what works”, pride themselves on the practicality of their politics and remain sceptical of all theories and abstractions. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-3e257f87-7fff-e6cd-c6b7-58a2154af07a&quot;&gt;The through-line that links the ideologies of Burke, Disraeli and Thatcher is not simply that the state should be small, but that its administrators should by preference do little. For conservatives there is a natural order in society that, left to its own devices, tends to work fine. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-3e257f87-7fff-e6cd-c6b7-58a2154af07a&quot;&gt;That’s the theory. So I wonder what political historians will make of Theresa May.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-3e257f87-7fff-e6cd-c6b7-58a2154af07a&quot;&gt;The Prime Minister is, as I write, issuing instructions to deploy what’s left of the army onto the streets, come March, to clear special lanes for the motorcycle couriers who will zip around Britain with what’s left of our food and medical supplies. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-3e257f87-7fff-e6cd-c6b7-58a2154af07a&quot;&gt;Having designed an Armageddon project to scare parliament into backing her atrocious Brexit deal, she is now preparing to actually trigger no-deal. If it’s not real to you now, then the moment the government tells you not to book a summer holiday, voiding your insurance if you do so and obliterating hundreds of small travel firms, it will become real then.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-3e257f87-7fff-e6cd-c6b7-58a2154af07a&quot;&gt;British Conservatism, in short, has become incautious, imprudent and impractical. In pursuit of a grand scheme, it is preparing to plunge the economy into chaos and destroy itself as a party. Faced with something that actually did work (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;although not well), it is determined to destroy it in favour of an abstraction.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-3e257f87-7fff-e6cd-c6b7-58a2154af07a&quot;&gt;This prompts the question conservative thought is not well-equipped to answer: why? Conservative political philosophers tend to root justifications for their ideology in human nature, national characteristics, alignment to venerable institutions , or even in evolutionary neuroscience (in the primordial jungle, prudent humans survived).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-3e257f87-7fff-e6cd-c6b7-58a2154af07a&quot;&gt;When they consider class, they tend to assume that income inequality is both inevitable and (within limits) just, but that class categories and class dynamics are not a fit subject for discourse.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-3e257f87-7fff-e6cd-c6b7-58a2154af07a&quot;&gt;But to understand the glorious fiasco May has unleashed we must begin with class. The Conservative Party is supposed to be the primary tool for Britain’s business class to govern in conditions of democracy. That’s the real through-line – and what explains Toryism’s dominance after 1832 and its suppleness during the 20th century. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-3e257f87-7fff-e6cd-c6b7-58a2154af07a&quot;&gt;Its task in the 19th century was to strip away obstacles to what Peel called the “real economy”, while steering the middle classes away from radical democracy. In Toryism’s obsessive battle with abstractions, the abstractions to be avoided were usually those that might translate the principles of political democracy into economic democracy, or civil justice into social justice for the working class.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-3e257f87-7fff-e6cd-c6b7-58a2154af07a&quot;&gt;In the 20th century its task was to manage the interests of a bourgeoisie that had grown rich not just from industry but from empire and finance. Even when it had to manage the relative decline of all three, it did so without becoming particularly unhinged. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-3e257f87-7fff-e6cd-c6b7-58a2154af07a&quot;&gt;So even though Macmillan and Thatcher stand at the polar opposites of post-war conservatism, you can still recognise what Michael Oakeshott called the “conservative disposition” running through their thinking like words through a stick of rock.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-3e257f87-7fff-e6cd-c6b7-58a2154af07a&quot;&gt;What’s gone wrong with Conservatism mirrors what’s gone wrong with the British bourgeoisie. After 30 years of globalisation it has become unanchored, fragmented and culturally detached from most of the institutions it was aligned to. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-3e257f87-7fff-e6cd-c6b7-58a2154af07a&quot;&gt;When you meet rich people, say for example, the front 15 rows in the stalls at Covent Garden on a big Wagner night, the predominant flavours are the City, the boardroom, the elite universities, and the administrative class – civil servants, public affairs consultants and the odd politician. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	&lt;span&gt;If these interbred tribes - of finance, entrepreneurship and public administration - actually constituted a bourgeoisie, Conservatism would be alright. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-3e257f87-7fff-e6cd-c6b7-58a2154af07a&quot;&gt;But there are really two Cities of London: the city of the light blue tie and erect bearing, which regards Mohammed bin Salman as a rotter, and the city of the dweeby technocrats who manage the money of crooks and dictators with obsequious enthusiasm. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-3e257f87-7fff-e6cd-c6b7-58a2154af07a&quot;&gt;And there are, in parallel, two intellectual spheres: one where rationalism and scepticism are prized and one where crazed, utopian, right-wing irrationalism is celebrated. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-3e257f87-7fff-e6cd-c6b7-58a2154af07a&quot;&gt;And since Blair, there have been two forms of statecraft: one suited to running a sovereign country with stable institutions, and another best suited to running government departments as outsourced businesses, prey to the influence of any foreign intelligence service that knows how to pull the strings.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-3e257f87-7fff-e6cd-c6b7-58a2154af07a&quot;&gt;These factions – the hedge funder, the property speculator, the best-selling irrationalist and the outsourcing civil servant – have constituted themselves into a kind of alt-bourgeoisie, which has no use for the conservative disposition.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-3e257f87-7fff-e6cd-c6b7-58a2154af07a&quot;&gt;Instead of constituting the top layer of a British hierarchy, the alt-bourgeoisie have formed themselves into the local branch of a global one, and turned London into the venue for all the dodgy money and practices needed to run their alt-capitalism, based on financial speculation and rent-seeking.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-3e257f87-7fff-e6cd-c6b7-58a2154af07a&quot;&gt;The problem is, we also have an upper middle class, which has to live in a real economy and polity. I meet them professionally every day: the pension fund manager, the accountant, the manager of a fashion brand, the sculptor, the hospital manager, the university lecturer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-3e257f87-7fff-e6cd-c6b7-58a2154af07a&quot;&gt;What do they always say? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-13ce578e-7fff-cb3a-fd6f-57f047513f82&quot;&gt;“Politics is shit. No party represents me.&lt;/span&gt;”&lt;span&gt; The economy’s stagnant and the political institutions of the country command no respect. Jeremy Corbyn and Vince Cable leave them cold. They tend to like Nicola Sturgeon but if they don’t live in Scotland that does not solve their problem.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-3e257f87-7fff-e6cd-c6b7-58a2154af07a&quot;&gt;Traditional, prudent, liberal conservatism would solve their problem but it no longer runs the Conservative Party. You can’t simultaneously represent the interests of a globally-focused, rent-seeking and utterly callous bunch of crooks at the same time as the upper middle class of a civilised country.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-3e257f87-7fff-e6cd-c6b7-58a2154af07a&quot;&gt;Brexit was always the project of the alt-bourgeoisie: not just in their desire to align with Trump’s pole in a multipolar world, or in the fantasy of reconstructing a white, English-speaking, trading empire. Above all what their businesses thrive amid is chaos. You can always trade unpredictability in the markets and, as the world goes down the pan, the price of a duplex apartment at Vauxhall Bridge will always go up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-3e257f87-7fff-e6cd-c6b7-58a2154af07a&quot;&gt;And as the negotiations have faltered, and the possibility of a collapse scenario comes into view, Brexit has become precisely the kind of abstraction and utopia that conservatism is supposed to eschew. The mindset of the European Research Group, and the ex-Ukip members pouring into local Conservative associations, starkly resembles the Jacobinism that Burke decried in 1790.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-3e257f87-7fff-e6cd-c6b7-58a2154af07a&quot;&gt;Meanwhile, those who still believe in conservatism as a form of moderation – Amber Rudd, David Gauke, Oliver Letwin – do not know what to do. Rudd keeps making pronouncements out of a “book of good ideas” – an indicative vote, a second referendum, maybe a prime minister called Amber Rudd – but she cannot act on them because the Conservative Party is no longer really conservative.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-3e257f87-7fff-e6cd-c6b7-58a2154af07a&quot;&gt;The tragedy is that these factional divisions at the top reflect real ideological and demographic fractures across British society. The xenophobia and hubris of Tory right MPs is actually moderate compared to the rhetoric you hear in Wetherspoons: “we’re a great county, screw Europe, let’s go it alone; sod the migrants, I’d rather have them gone even if the economy does collapse – but we’re British, we’ll get by.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-3e257f87-7fff-e6cd-c6b7-58a2154af07a&quot;&gt;When conservatism was aligned to a stable system, such bar stool irrationalism didn’t matter. You mobilised it for expeditionary warfare, you ignored it while organising a 21-gun salute for the Saudi monarchy. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-3e257f87-7fff-e6cd-c6b7-58a2154af07a&quot;&gt;Now, the xenophobic tail is wagging the dog. Calling the shots are the kind of people who used to be shunned by real conservatives: the offshore investor with a penchant for all things Russian, the think tanks flush with money from American billionaires who want to smash the state.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-3e257f87-7fff-e6cd-c6b7-58a2154af07a&quot;&gt;We will probably remember 2018 as the year British conservatism began to fall apart. I don’t give a toss about the Tory party: it destroyed the society I grew up in and inflicted organised economic cruelty on entire regions of the country. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-3e257f87-7fff-e6cd-c6b7-58a2154af07a&quot;&gt;But I do care about cancer patients getting their morphine on time, and about food being available for the microwaves of stressed-out mums, and about motorways being roads, not lorry parks. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-3e257f87-7fff-e6cd-c6b7-58a2154af07a&quot;&gt;Edmund Burke once wrote: “What is the use of discussing a man&#039;s abstract right to food or to medicine? The question is upon the method of procuring and administering them.” Early next year, for the sake of an abstraction, procuring food and medicine will become an all too concrete problem for May’s regime of crisis.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-3e257f87-7fff-e6cd-c6b7-58a2154af07a&quot;&gt;For this reason, I urge the real conservatives in the Conservative Party to use the Christmas break wisely - and get a grip. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Christmas animation: A brief history</title>

	It’s a festive tradition, Gromit!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-node-image field-type-image field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;noscript class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoints=&quot;300 768 1024&quot; data-adaptive-image-300-img=&quot;&amp;lt;img class=&amp;quot;adaptive-image&amp;quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&amp;quot;300&amp;quot; typeof=&amp;quot;foaf:Image&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2018/12/wallace-and-gromit.jpg?itok=WXwj94BJ&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&quot; data-adaptive-image-768-img=&quot;&amp;lt;img class=&amp;quot;adaptive-image&amp;quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&amp;quot;768&amp;quot; typeof=&amp;quot;foaf:Image&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2018/12/wallace-and-gromit.jpg?itok=WXwj94BJ&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&quot; data-adaptive-image-1024-img=&quot;&amp;lt;img class=&amp;quot;adaptive-image&amp;quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&amp;quot;1024&amp;quot; typeof=&amp;quot;foaf:Image&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2018/12/wallace-and-gromit.jpg?itok=WXwj94BJ&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&quot; data-adaptive-image-max-img=&quot;&amp;lt;img class=&amp;quot;adaptive-image&amp;quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&amp;quot;max&amp;quot; typeof=&amp;quot;foaf:Image&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2018/12/wallace-and-gromit.jpg?itok=WXwj94BJ&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&quot;&gt;&lt;img typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2018/12/wallace-and-gromit.jpg?itok=WXwj94BJ&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;
	A curious thing was posted on the official BBC One twitter account at the beginning of the month: &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/BBCOne/status/1070007595744813057&quot;&gt;a TV schedule&lt;/a&gt;. This may not immediately seem strange, given that it’s a TV channel; but given our TV-watching habits are now so disparate and off schedule, so on-demand, to see a channel excitedly claim, “This is what we’re putting on, and this is when we’re doing it!” felt quite antiquated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	And yet, it being Christmas, it made sense. We still get excited about Christmas TV. And what actually defines that TV? Inarguably, the answer is animation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One-off animated specials are integral to the Christmas schedule. This year, BBC One have a new version of &lt;em&gt;Watership Down&lt;/em&gt; on 22 December, as well as the latest Julia Donaldson adaptation, &lt;em&gt;Zog&lt;/em&gt;, on Christmas Day.&lt;em&gt; Zog&lt;/em&gt; follows in the tradition &lt;em&gt;The Gruffalo&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Gruffalo’s Child&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Room on the Broom&lt;/em&gt;, the three other Julia Donaldson adaptations, all produced by Magic Light Pictures, which had Christmas Day screenings in 2009, 2011, 2012 respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Follow the BBC’s thread further backwards and you’ll recall &lt;em&gt;Robbie the Reindeer&lt;/em&gt;, the Richard Curtis animation that had three specials in 1999, 2002, and 2007, and of course, &lt;em&gt;Wallace and Gromit&lt;/em&gt;, who became fixtures of Christmas in 1993 with &lt;em&gt;The Wrong Trousers&lt;/em&gt;, before following up with&lt;em&gt; A Close Shave &lt;/em&gt;(1995), &lt;em&gt;A Matter of Loaf and Death&lt;/em&gt; (2008), and, in 2015, spin-off &lt;em&gt;Shaun The Sheep &lt;/em&gt;–&lt;em&gt; The Farmer’s Llamas&lt;/em&gt;. (The first one, 1989’s &lt;em&gt;A Grand Day Out&lt;/em&gt; was broadcast at the end of November.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It’s not just a BBC thing, either. In fact, the first big Christmas animation came with the arrival of Channel 4 in 1982, with their adaptation of Raymond Briggs’ &lt;em&gt;The Snowman&lt;/em&gt;. Through a partnership with Lupus Films, similar to the one the BBC have with Magic Light, they have more recently put out a Snowman sequel, &lt;em&gt;The Snowman and The Snowdog&lt;/em&gt; in 2012, as well as Michael Rosen adaptation &lt;em&gt;We’re Going On A Bear Hunt&lt;/em&gt; in 2016. Earlier this year Lupus announced they were currently working on an adaptation of Judith Kerr’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thebookseller.com/news/film-deal-judith-kerr-s-tiger-729166&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Tiger Who Came To Tea&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;; a broadcast date hasn’t been announced, but it wouldn’t be a surprise if it was announced as one of Channel 4’s flagship offerings next Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	So where does this association of animation and Christmas come from? After all, the gap between transmission dates of &lt;em&gt;The Snowman&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Wrong Trouser&lt;/em&gt;s is eleven years, and it’s only after the latter that we begin to see this trend pick up speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Justin Johnson, lead programmer at the BFI, which has been celebrating animation all year with its Animation 18 season, suggests that it might be the result of the cumulative, nostalgic effect of Christmas TV: “The good thing about Christmas fare is, if it’s good and it works, you can keep bringing it out year after year, and people want to see it: they want to have that festive nostalgic moment. There’s an event moment where when the new one is unveiled, and you can go back and look at the other ones.” This is true across other art forms too, where a tangential association with Christmas is enough to build those links in our mind: by way of example, see the case of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/arts-and-books/why-are-there-no-new-christmas-songs&quot;&gt;East 17 adding sleigh bells to Stay Another Day&lt;/a&gt; to try and game the Christmas music charts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	What’s interesting about Aardman Animations, responsible for the likes of &lt;em&gt;Wallace and Gromit&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Chicken Run&lt;/em&gt;, is how its particular style of animation links in with a pre-existing notion of what British animation is, or looks like, perhaps even directly referencing shows that audiences would already be familiar with. Dr Christopher Holliday at King’s College London explains: “Aardman&#039;s work is perhaps closest to the work of Oliver Postgate and Peter Firmin&#039;s Smallfilms, who produced children&#039;s television programmes from the 1960s to the 1980s. Shows such as &lt;em&gt;The Clangers&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Noggin the Nog&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Ivor the Engine &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; Bagpuss&lt;/em&gt; were all created using the stop-motion style, and as such all exhibit that prized jerkiness of such animation being moved by hand shot-by-shot: precisely the kind of contact that many purists see as being lost in the digital era.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Even given the fact that the Julia Donaldson adaptations are CGI, some of the hallmarks and qualities of Aardman and Smallfilms are present in the films: the Britishness of the casts, the non-verbal communication, even the look of the films has a tactile, hand-made quality to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The ratings war between the channels has always escalated at Christmas. With the BBC in particular, much of its annual budget is ring-fenced specifically for the Christmas schedule. Given that animations are so expensive and time-consuming to make, it’s also one of the rare occasions where children’s programming is funded by the main channel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	At the same time, they’ve proven over three decades now to be a safe bet. With stop-motion animation in particular, there’s a kind of recognisable, DIY aesthetic to it that chimes in with exactly what happens on Christmas Day in houses all over the world: putting stuff together, trying things out, breaking things, fixing them. It’s the magic of film, but it doesn’t hide from you how the trick’s being done. Even as the technology has advanced, the stories being told remain very close to home, either through those stories being already known and loved, or if they’re new, through them representing a kind of Britishness that feels very recognisable. In the case of a character like Wallace, you’ve got someone who is a genius inventor, but whose inventions have that mechanical, Mouse Trap kind of quality to them. In fact, it’s not a stretch to see comparison between Wallace and Oliver Postgate himself, both brilliantly creative, affable British eccentrics who epitomise a kind of DIY, bottom-of-the-shed approach to making things: the only difference is that one is most associated with a dog, and the other a cat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The British film industry is represented by a series of archetypes – James Bond, the 90s rom-com, social realism – and all of them in their own right can lay a claim to define what this country produces on screen. However, animation is just as, if not more important. “British animation is, in many ways, the history of animation,” says Holliday. “Many of the earliest animators, cartoonists, caricaturists and performers working at the turn of the nineteenth century at the birth of the medium, and throughout the silent era, were British.” It’s also true that much of this animation has had its home outside of the theatres, in public information or educational films, commercials – such as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcNM7DkPLow&quot;&gt;General Post Office adverts of the 1930s&lt;/a&gt;, made by New Zealand born animator Len Lye, who moved to the UK in the 1920s – and of course, TV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	So it’s fitting that this tradition of animation has found a permanent home every December, at a time when we are still beholden to the TV schedule. Nothing lasts forever; but for the time being, it doesn’t seem to be moving anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--

    <title>The quiet revolution of First Dates</title>
    <link>https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/tv-radio/2018/12/quiet-revolution-first-dates</link>

	In an understated way, the dating series is one of the most diverse reality shows on television.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-node-image field-type-image field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;noscript class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoints=&quot;300 768 1024&quot; data-adaptive-image-300-img=&quot;&amp;lt;img class=&amp;quot;adaptive-image&amp;quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&amp;quot;300&amp;quot; typeof=&amp;quot;foaf:Image&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2018/12/first_dates_comp_final.png?itok=xDjfzPqR&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;Some couples from First Dates season 11&amp;quot; title=&amp;quot;Some couples from First Dates season 11&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&quot; data-adaptive-image-768-img=&quot;&amp;lt;img class=&amp;quot;adaptive-image&amp;quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&amp;quot;768&amp;quot; typeof=&amp;quot;foaf:Image&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2018/12/first_dates_comp_final.png?itok=xDjfzPqR&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;Some couples from First Dates season 11&amp;quot; title=&amp;quot;Some couples from First Dates season 11&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&quot; data-adaptive-image-1024-img=&quot;&amp;lt;img class=&amp;quot;adaptive-image&amp;quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&amp;quot;1024&amp;quot; typeof=&amp;quot;foaf:Image&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2018/12/first_dates_comp_final.png?itok=xDjfzPqR&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;Some couples from First Dates season 11&amp;quot; title=&amp;quot;Some couples from First Dates season 11&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&quot; data-adaptive-image-max-img=&quot;&amp;lt;img class=&amp;quot;adaptive-image&amp;quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&amp;quot;max&amp;quot; typeof=&amp;quot;foaf:Image&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2018/12/first_dates_comp_final.png?itok=xDjfzPqR&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;Some couples from First Dates season 11&amp;quot; title=&amp;quot;Some couples from First Dates season 11&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&quot;&gt;&lt;img typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2018/12/first_dates_comp_final.png?itok=xDjfzPqR&quot; alt=&quot;Some couples from First Dates season 11&quot; title=&quot;Some couples from First Dates season 11&quot; /&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;
	It’s a busy evening at central London’s Paternoster Chop House, an upmarket restaurant in the shadow of St Paul’s Cathedral. A couple having dinner there are on a blind date. Danni, a 25-year-old make-up artist and model from Cardiff, is meeting bar manager Aiden, 28, for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Both had been out all night and were feeling sheepishly worse for wear. It wasn’t long until they were admitting their partying ways to each other and joking about hitting it hard the night before. They also briefly chatted about Danni being trans and Aiden pansexual. They shared nachos to soak up their hangovers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The incidental detail of the pair’s identities was a small but touching moment in one of thousands of dates run by Channel 4’s &lt;em&gt;First Dates &lt;/em&gt;series, which began in 2013 and is now on its 11th series (excluding the celebrity and hotel spin-offs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A simple concept, the show matches people up who apply using its database, interviews them to find out who they’re looking for, and then introduces them to their match in a dinner date format at the same restaurant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Deep conversations and fun dates often ensue, with some shockers unfolding in between, and people tell their life stories candidly. It’s ideal, compelling reality TV. But unlike other similar shows, it has avoided exploiting its participants – and includes a variety of daters from minority groups and different backgrounds without making a big deal about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Like Danni, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	“The actual facet of me being diverse, of me being trans, was such a small factor in the show when it aired,” she tells me over the phone. “I didn’t feel tokenised or anything like that. I never felt they were like ‘Oh here we go, we’ve got one’. It was just another component to finding a match for me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	She did, however, worry about her date’s reaction. “One of my biggest concerns was, ‘Oh my goodness, what if he’s going to react badly to me telling him that I’m trans?’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Panicking and calling a producer the week before her date, she asked “what if he reacts badly to me?”, and was immediately comforted. “Obviously they don’t tell you anything about the person before the date, but they were really reassuring: ‘You’re going to be fine, I promise, you’re in good hands’.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The production team gave her their personal contacts and invited her to get in touch any time with concerns. The producers were right about her date going fine, and Danni appreciated the “duty of care” they displayed ahead of her appearance – and her gender being treated as a run-of-the-mill detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/iNiYbrO77Xw&quot; width=&quot;510&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	“A lot of feedback from my own community was that it was refreshing to see somebody be on television and it be mentioned that they’re trans, but that not be their storyline, and that really resonated with me,” she says. “It was just like ‘oh I’m trans’, but also ‘I was out last night, I was having a laugh, and blah blah blah’. It wasn’t about being trans. It’s the same as in my own life, it doesn’t really come into it, you know.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;First Dates&lt;/em&gt;, which currently has over 300,000 applicants on its database, has filmed participants with a dizzying range of experiences: a woman brought up in an orphanage by Mother Teresa, a football coach with a terminal brain tumour, an Iraqi refugee who lost family in the invasion, a helicopter pilot on his first ever date cross-dressing, two young gay men united in their love of Theresa May, a celibate Christian, the UK’s only female sumo wrestler and a 31-year-old administrator with autism – and that’s just the latest series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Mostly, the daters are interviewed and filmed with open-mindedness – though there are misjudgements. Maître d’ Fred Sirieix’s &lt;em&gt;“ooh la la”-&lt;/em&gt;ing of glamorous women, for example, not to mention cameras sweeping rather too luxuriously over some people’s bodies, or the voiceover’s recent suggestion that an autistic man is a “quirky” match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Occasional conversations aired during dates have rightly provoked backlash, such as the decision to broadcast cage fighter Ricky &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.divamag.co.uk/Diva-Magazine/News/Channel-4-producers-need-training-after-First-Dates-transphobic-comments/&quot;&gt;laughing about being “catfished by a tranny”&lt;/a&gt;, the accountant Ruth claiming she was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/first-dates-diner-born-wrong-race-syndrome-cultural-appropriation-twitter-a8368986.html&quot;&gt;“born in the wrong race”&lt;/a&gt;, and one dater calling his match who had ADHD “bonkers”. The charity Trans Media Watch &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.divamag.co.uk/Diva-Magazine/News/Channel-4-producers-need-training-after-First-Dates-transphobic-comments/&quot;&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Diva &lt;/em&gt;magazine&lt;/a&gt; at the time of the “catfish” comment that “Channel 4 usually does better than this”, and the show does indeed usually differ from others in the same genre by trying to match people authentically rather than comically for the cameras.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	“The key is we match people for a ‘yes’, we’re not exploitative and we’re not matching people to fail and for us to laugh at and watch,” says Jon Crisp, a producer who’s been working on the show for three years. “We’re very much looking to find them love. And through that, I think naturally, dating’s a funny business, and occasionally you get the odd mismatch and a bit of a car crash date. We’re absolutely matching with their best interests at heart.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	And the understated diversity is intentional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	“We want our episodes to be a snapshot of dating across Britain, because we live in a diverse society and we’re really keen that we reflect that,” says Crisp. “We do get a diverse range of people applying – we’re blessed with the choice but we try and make sure we use it to our best potential…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	“We try to be non-judgemental and take people for who they are. We try and be as inclusive as we can without labelling people – labels are a bit dull, a bit out of fashion, out of date,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Salam, a 39-year-old trauma surgeon who left Iraq for the UK in 2003, also feels it’s “important for diversity and integration” for people like him to appear on such programmes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	“People who have migrated to the UK and made their life here and become British, from this kind of background, minorities, I think it’s very important they come and tell their story,” he tells me. “Also to draw the right picture for people – because some of the media can mislead or give the wrong impression of us.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	He lost his father, uncle and some of his cousins during the invasion, and dedicated himself to human rights work in conflict zones before qualifying as a surgeon in the UK. “I was focused career-wise, and maybe I neglected quite a lot of the relationship side,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
		Salam has an interesting suggestion to make the end of the date less stressful &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/FirstDates?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#FirstDates&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/rJecRri8Oa&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/rJecRri8Oa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	— Channel 4 (@Channel4) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Channel4/status/1062117422981832705?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;November 12, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	His background also dented his confidence – something his &lt;em&gt;First Dates &lt;/em&gt;experience helped him overcome. “I’m always worried about being judged because I was born outside of the UK and I speak with an accent,” he says. “That’s always in the back of my head, when I’m trying to speak to somebody, especially as English is not my first language – I’m always worried about how people perceive that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Whether it’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2018/03/when-social-experiment-immigration-tv-goes-wrong&quot;&gt;immigration on &lt;em&gt;Muslims Like Us &lt;/em&gt;or &lt;em&gt;Make Bradford British&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/uk-politics/2014/02/what-have-we-learned-emotional-circus-benefits-street&quot;&gt;poverty on &lt;em&gt;Benefits Street&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/tv-radio/2017/07/why-love-island-so-tory&quot;&gt;sexual politics on &lt;em&gt;Love Island&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, reality TV is usually an incendiary medium for exploring (and often exploiting) social issues. But &lt;em&gt;First Dates &lt;/em&gt;has somehow found a way to show us a rich tapestry of romance stories – without being smug about it, or abusing its subjects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	“You can come from whatever background and watch someone on &lt;em&gt;First Dates&lt;/em&gt; and whoever it is, whatever their background, whatever age they are, however rich they are, however poor they are, you can relate to them,” says Crisp. “Because they’re talking about feelings that we all have.”&lt;/p&gt;

	Charles Dickens’&lt;em&gt; A Christmas Carol&lt;/em&gt; captures the spirit of this season of goodwill to all men (and women). It relates, of course, the story of Ebenezer Scrooge – visited by the ghost of his former business partner Jacob Marley – who, in turn, introduces him to three other ghosts: the Ghost of Christmas Past, the Ghost of Christmas Present and the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come. They tell him how his life, once so promising, had got into the mess it had, and how much worse it could become if he didn’t mend his ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Watching a spirited production of this much-loved classic at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://dickensmuseum.com/blogs/all-events/72745411-a-christmas-carol&quot;&gt;Charles Dickens Museum&lt;/a&gt; the other day, I found it hard not to see a message in it for our times. It is as if Dickens had written it with our politicians in mind. Let’s consider what each of the three Ghosts of Brexit might have to say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;The Ghost of Brexit Past&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It’s the job of the Ghost of Brexit Past to remind us of largely happier times. Times when we all seemed to get along so much better, we thought about the long-term and not the short-term, we made plans based on options we could be certain were available to us and our family, and our politicians represented us at our very best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A united Europe was a dream of a generation that had to build their lives out of the blood and the rubble of the Second World War.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A lot of Brexit politicians have painted themselves as modern day Sir Winston Churchills – but they forgot what it was that great man was doing between 1945 and 1950. In that period, he realised the best hopes he had for the United Kingdom could only be achieved in cooperation with our European partners. Churchill was the principal agent in creating the European movement, and also the Council of Europe. Those who, like Boris Johnson, try to model themselves on Churchill, should read his famous &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.churchill-society-london.org.uk/astonish.html&quot;&gt;Zurich speech&lt;/a&gt; of 1946 which ended with the rallying cry that Great Britain must “champion” Europe and “its right to live and shine.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Sadly, Churchill did not live to see the country he loved joining the European Union. Still, the &lt;em&gt;Daily Mail&lt;/em&gt; –&lt;a href=&quot;https://endthechaos.co.uk/blog/daily-mail-is-todays-biggest-brexit-story/&quot;&gt; such a cheerleader for Brexit until recently&lt;/a&gt; – was there to rejoice when we became a fully fledged part of the great European project. On January 1 1973, its front page was emblazoned with the words, “Europe, here we come.” It proudly declared: “For ten years, the Mail has campaigned for this day. We have not wavered in our conviction that Britain’s best and brightest future is with Europe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There were, from the outset, rumblings of discontent, invariably among the wealthiest elite in our country. Sir James Goldsmith – an Anglo-French billionaire – set up The Referendum Party as long ago as 1994. The party’s sole objective was to secure a referendum on the nature of the UK’s membership of EU. Money was no object: in the build-up to the 1997 general election, it spent more on press advertising than either the incumbent Conservatives or their main rival, the Labour Party. It stood candidates in 547 of the 659 constituencies, more than any minor party had ever fielded in a UK election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For all that, the party failed to win a single seat in the House of Commons. The party was very much a one-man band, and, not long after Goldsmith died in 1997, The Referendum Party became defunct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Eurosceptics continued to ferment discord within the Conservative Party, however, and, 25 years ago, Sir John Major was caught on an open microphone referring to three of his Eurosceptic ministers – believed to be Michael Howard, Peter Lilley and Michael Portillo – as “bastards”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The problem with the Eurosceptics was that they could never agree among themselves on a coherent strategy to take the UK out of Europe. Easy to say “I don’t like something,” or “Let’s knock things down”.  Far harder to say: “This is what we should do instead”, “Here’s how we rebuild”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This was highlighted a year before David Cameron called the referendum on Europe on June 23 2016 when &lt;a href=&quot;http://eureferendum.com/blogview.aspx?blogno=87058&quot;&gt;Dr Richard North&lt;/a&gt;, who was group research director of the Eurosceptic EDD group in the European Parliament, emailed the Vote Leave boss Dominic Cummings  to ask why they still had not agreed on an exit plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	“Cummings told me had to deal with ‘a physical reality,’ where ‘almost nobody agrees … about almost anything,” Dr North admitted. “Thus, it was not a question of the campaign failing to have a plan. The idea was deliberately rejected, an act of cowardice that had the main players ducking an issue that was inevitably going to rebound on us all, simply because the campaign wanted to avoid disagreement in its ranks.&lt;em&gt;”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	And this was how it all began…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;The Ghost of Brexit Present&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Ghost of Brexit Present is chaos without end. It is almost daily emergency cabinet meetings, falling outs, name-calling, meaningless soundbites devoid of any detail, some of the most farcical scenes ever witnessed in the House of Commons, Mrs May going to and fro between European leaders, facing a revolt among her MPs one day and being praised by them the next, no one ever agreeing on anything, and a sense among ordinary voters of utter dismay and deepening anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	All the while, the legitimate concerns of ordinary voters – the state of the NHS, education, the rising levels of poverty and rough sleepers on the streets – go unaddressed. Brexit is not a policy: it is a state of continual political paralysis, disregard for the concerns of ordinary people and national humiliation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It is a cultish obsession I believe of a small group of individuals who, for ideological reasons, want it at any cost. Just four years ago, only 11 per cent of voters  thought Europe was the most important electoral issue, and the economy was in the number one slot. While controlling immigration is important to British people, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/arusbridger&quot;&gt;these statistics&lt;/a&gt; suggest we are far more interested in the NHS, education, housing, foreign policy rather than purely and simply the EU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Ghost of Christmas Present need not say much: we are all living this nightmare every day and know the reality of it only too well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;The Ghost of Brexit Yet to Come&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It is the job of the Ghost of Brexit Yet to Come to show how the future will look if we don’t change direction. Well, let’s just imagine that political power games, the personal greed of some individuals who believe in unfettered, red-in-tooth-and-claw capitalism, or, indeed, sheer inertia enable the worst possible scenario: a no-deal Brexit. The Ghost of Brexit Yet to Come is the most terrifying ghost of all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/brexit/2018/07/flights-stop-supermarket-shelves-empty-and-nhs-supplies-dwindle-britain&quot;&gt;So imagine it is 11:00pm GMT&lt;/a&gt; – midnight on the continent – on Friday 29 March 2019. The consensus in the Square Mile had been – even until the final days – that the government would avoid the cliff edge.  Markets start tumbling, followed by a nosedive for sterling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The start of British Summer Time on the 31st only worsens the rapidly escalating logistical chaos that follows. At the approach roads to the Eurotunnel terminals and sea ports, there is gridlock as commercial goods lorries and holidaymakers’ cars sit backed up in queues that are already stretching for dozens of miles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The modest numbers of additional customs officers so far recruited by the UK, France and the Netherlands are proving themselves ill-prepared and completely outnumbered as they desperately try to manage the vast queues growing hourly at the UK border. Within weeks, stocks of some specialist foodstuffs imported from the EU are dwindling, and supermarket shelves beyond the home counties have started to empty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	More critically still, drugs with short shelf-lives that cannot be stockpiled start running out: these include cancer drugs. Other vital supplies of pharmaceuticals are beginning to disappear from dispensing pharmacies, even though many hospitals had started stockpiling drugs months ago. Patient care and lives are at risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Shops are closing, container ports are grinding to a halt, car production slows and factories are eventually closed. As public disquiet grows, the armed forces are called in to help to manage the border, guard against civil unrest and support the delivery of critical public services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Even that last and possibly most alarming prediction in a long list is not mine alone: recourse to the army was what Philip Rutnam, the permanent secretary at the Home Office, blurted out when he was asked how Brexit would all play out by the home affairs Select Committee last year.  All of these scenarios for a post no-deal Brexit Britain are real possibilities, according to the government’s own papers and expert evidence to other Select Committees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For all that, I am by nature an optimist, and, if any piece of literature makes me look to the future with hope, it is &lt;em&gt;A Christmas Carol&lt;/em&gt;. “Christmas, and the end of the year, is definitely a time when people try their hardest to begin afresh,” as Dickens wrote. “A good time; a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant time; when men and women seem by one consent to open their shut-up hearts freely.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	How badly we do now need to begin afresh. I wish everyone a happy Christmas, and for those kind enough to support the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.endthechaos.co.uk/&quot;&gt;End the Chaos&lt;/a&gt; team and myself – a very warm thank you for your kindness and your encouragement.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--
